Brief Description of the Drawings [0022] Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of further example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a block representation of an example data storage device in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 2 provides an isometric block representation of a portion of a data storage device in accordance with various embodiments.

FIG. 7 provides a flowchart of a thin film fabrication routine conducted in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Detailed Description [0023] Continuing emphasis for larger capacity, faster data storage devices has stressed the magnetic stability of data storage elements, especially in smaller form factor devices. High uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment may aid in mitigating performance instabilities, in thin film magnetic layers used in a variety of rotating and solid state data storage devices. However, uniaxial anisotropy can be difficult to maintain in magnetic thin films subsequent to heat treatment that may occur during manufacturing or operation. Hence, industry is striving to provide thermally stable magnetic thin films capable of preserving uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment despite exposure to elevated temperatures. [0024] Accordingly, a thin film may be constructed as a magnetic layer that is tuned to a predetermined anisotropy and magnetic moment through deposition of a material on a substrate cooled to a predetermined substrate temperature and with a predetermined deposition incidence angle. The ability to provide predetermined uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment in a magnetic layer by adjusting the temperature of a substrate on which the magnetic layer is deposited can allow the magnetic layer to be tuned to perform in a variety of different magnetic operating environments, such as small form factor data reading and writing. [0025] The construction of a magnetic thin film in accordance with various embodiments may at least increase high frequency magnetic performance through coherent magnetic rotation while boosting robustness of the thin film's thermal stability. The deposition of one or more thin films on a substrate cooled to cryogenic temperatures, such as 50K, can control magnetic domain structure, which may maintain stress anisotropy in obliquely sputtered thin films and correspond to increased thermal and anisotropic stability. With a cryogenically cooled substrate, oblique incidence angle tuning may further increase the thermal and anisotropic stability by precisely controlling the anisotropy and magnetic moment of the thin film. [0026] Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 generally illustrates a block representation of an example data storage device 100. The data storage device 100 may take the form of a variety of different data storage technologies, such as rotating, solid state, and hybrid systems, which can be practiced in a variety of non-limiting mobile, server, and residential environments. The data storage device 100 may be configured at least with a controller 102 that directs inputted data signals 104 to a data storage element 106. The inputted data signals 104 may originate at an unlimited variety of locations, such as from external data storage devices and internal data cache, and correspond to data intended to be stored either temporarily or permanently on the data storage element 106. [0027] It should be noted that the size, speed, type, and number of data storage elements 106 are not limited to a particular configuration. That is, any storage element capable of retaining data for future access, such as a rotating data media, solid state cell, and hybrid data system, can be used to provide any data capacity and transfer speed configuration as the data storage element 106 either alone or in combination. Regardless of the type and capacity of the data storage element 106, the controller 102 may be capable of handling the inputted data 104 as well as providing data output signals 108 from the data storage element 106. As such, the controller 102 can selectively input data to and output data from one or more regions of the data storage element 106, either successively or concurrently. [0028] In some embodiments, the data storage element 106 is constructed with at least one thin film magnetic layer that is magnetically fixed or free to allow data to be stored, written, and read via the controller 102. For example, the thin film magnetic layer may be a part of a magnetoresistive lamination used to sense data programmed as data bits on a rotating data media. In another example, the thin film magnetic layer may be part of a solid state lamination, such as resistive random access memory (RRAM), that stores data with the formation of a filament between two electrodes. [0029] FIG. 2 displays an isometric block representation of an example thin film magnetic layer 120 capable of being used in the data storage element 106 of FIG. 1. The magnetic layer 120 is shown in a rectangular form with a thickness 122, stripe height 124, and width 126, but such shape and the particular dimensions of the layer 120 are not limited to a particular configuration. Regardless of the shape and dimensions of the magnetic layer 120, a uniaxial anisotropy 128 that is parallel to the transverse direction of the magnetic layer 120 and the X axis may be constructed to increase magnetic domain control versus omniaxial anisotropy. [0030] Such a uniaxial anisotropic orientation may allow for magnetically stable performance at predetermined magnetic flux densities, such as 2.4 Tesla. However, the uniaxial anisotropy 128 may alternatively be tuned to an angled orientation 130 with respect to both the X and Y axis to maintain magnetic performance of the layer 120 when the stripe height 124 is increased. In other words, an increasingly stripe height 126 can correspond with elevated magnetic instability that is mitigated by tilting the orientation of the uniaxial anisotropy 128 to the angled uniaxial anisotropy 130 oriented non-normal to the X and Y axis. [0031] As the stripe height 124 reaches a predetermined length, such as twice the width 126, a uniaxial anisotropy 132 oriented at an angle normal to the X axis may be formed in the magnetic layer 120 to bolster magnetic stability. For example, orienting the uniaxial anisotropy parallel to the width of the magnetic layer 120 along the X axis may lower erasure after write phenomenon as the anisotropy 128 allows magnetization to relax faster than if the anisotropy was oriented along the X axis, as in anisotropy 132, or angled to the X axis, as in anisotropy 130. [0032] While the orientation of the uniaxial anisotropy of the magnetic layer 120 can be tuned along with the dimensions of the magnetic layer 120 to provide predetermined magnetic characteristics, the application of heat to the magnetic layer, such as during annealing or operation, can permanently alter the anisotropy and magnetic moment of a magnetic layer 120, regardless of how the anisotropy and magnetic moment was configured prior to the application of heat. With the application of heat inducing anisotropy and moment instability in the magnetic layer 120, tuning the temperature of the substrate on which the magnetic layer 120 is deposited and the angle in which the magnetic layer 120 is deposited can aid in maintaining anisotropy and moment characteristics subsequent to an application of heat. [0033] FIG. 3 shows an isometric block representation of the deposition of a magnetic layer 150 onto a substrate 152 in accordance with various embodiments. As with the magnetic layer 120 of FIG. 2, the magnetic layer 150 can be formed in any variety of shapes, dimensions, and materials, but in some embodiments is a rectangular thin film formed through the sputtered deposition of FeCo onto the substrate 152 at a predetermined oblique incidence angles \u03b81 , \u03b82, \u03b83 that can range from 0 up to 90 degrees with respect to the Z axis. [0034] Static or dynamic oblique angle sputtering, such as angles at or below 30 degrees, can produce elevated anisotropy, such as 200 Oe or above due to stress anisotropy being created by the agglomeration of vacancies and nano-voids formed behind growing crystallites due to shadowing effects of the oblique angle, without losing the inherent magnetic moment of the material. That is, growing crystallites block the line of sight from the incident beam of the sputtering gun 154 to produce vacancies in predictable locations that collectively produce stress anisotropy which leads to magnetic anisotropy in the film. [0035] The magnetic layer 160 of FIG. 4 generally illustrates how vacancies 162 align in predictable rows 164 aligned with a predetermined anisotropy direction 166 to produce uniaxial anisotropy along that direction 166. However, the thermal stability of the rows 164 becomes unstable in the presence of elevated heat as stress anisotropy lowers. Hence, conditions like annealing or heat treating the magnetic layer 160 can disturb the strength and direction of the uniaxial anisotropy. It should be noted that the material of the magnetic layer may be doped with a larger atomic radius element to mitigate thermal instability, but such efforts often lower the overall magnetic moment of the magnetic layer 160 to the detriment of high frequency data bit access operations. [0036] With the thermal instability of uniaxial anisotropy in mind, cooling the substrate, such as substrate 152 of FIG. 3, on which the magnetic layer 160 is deposited can reduce atomic mobility and more easily form vacancies 162 and nano-voids, which corresponds to increased thermal stability of the vacancy 162 alignment along the predetermined anisotropy direction 166. In various embodiments, the anisotropy and magnetic moment are tuned by cryogenically cooling the substrate to a predetermined temperature, such as approximately 50 Kelvin, while the oblique angle of deposition is controlled. [0037] Such tuned deposition can provide constant or varying cryogenic substrate temperatures and oblique deposition angles optimized to produce elevated stress anisotropy can mitigate the detrimental effects of annealing and heat treatments by maintaining high uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment subsequent to applications of heat. FIGS. 5 and 6 respectively graph example operational data associated with magnetoresistive laminations including differently tuned magnetic layers in accordance with various embodiments. In FIG. 5, oblique deposition on a room temperature substrate is shown to provide easy 170 and hard 172 axis that is tuned to predetermined uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment characteristics. [0038] While the magnetic characteristics of FIG. 5 can be altered by adjusting the oblique incidence angle of deposition, subsequent heat treatment or annealing may reduce or eliminate the tuned anisotropy and magnetic moment as vacancies in one or more magnetic layers move in crystal lattices due to thermal stresses induced by the application of heat. In contrast, the easy 180 and hard 182 axis shown in FIG. 6 illustrate how tuning both oblique incidence angle and substrate temperature can produce increased uniaxial anisotropy, which is also more thermally stable due to reduce atomic mobility of the deposited magnetic material on a cryogenically cooled substrate. [0039] While formation of a magnetic element comprising a tuned magnetic layer is not limited to a particular means, FIG. 7 provides an example thin film fabrication routine 200 performed in accordance with various embodiments. The routine 200 may begin by designing uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment that corresponds with magnetic performance optimized for application in step 202. That is, the anisotropy and magnetic moment can be designed in step 202 to provide magnetic characteristics, such as anisotropy direction and magnetic flux capacity, catered to the manner in which the thin film is to be used, such as a solid state lamination, magnetoresistive lamination, and proximity sensor. [0040] With the uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment designed in step 202, oblique incidence angle and substrate temperature that corresponds to those magnetic parameters are then set for execution in steps 204 and 206, respectively. Step 204 first cools and maintains the substrate to a cryogenic temperature before step 206 configures a layer deposition means, such as a sputtering apparatus, to a predetermined oblique incidence angle. The configuration of the substrate to a cooled temperature and an oblique deposition set to a predetermined angle advances the routine 200 to step 208 where deposition of the thin film onto the cooled substrate begins. [0041] Sometime after the start of material deposition in step 208, the deposition is evaluated in decision 210 as to whether adjustment of the substrate temperature or oblique incidence angle is to be adjusted. That is, whether the previously static substrate temperature and oblique incidence angle are to become dynamic while material is being deposited onto the substrate. If the determination from decision 210 is that modification is in order, step 212 alters the substrate temperature and/or the oblique incidence angle either individually or collectively while depositing material onto the cooled substrate. [0042] The formation of the thin film in a predetermined shape, thickness, width, and stripe height either after the alteration of the deposition parameters in step 212 or without alteration from decision 210 leads to step 214 where the deposition is terminated. Various embodiments maintain the substrate at a cryogenic temperature even after deposition while other embodiments submit the newly formed thin film to annealing heat treatments at elevated temperatures, both of which are not required or limiting to routine 200. [0043] While not provided in routine 200, the thin film may be fabricated in isolation or as part of a lamination where additional layers are deposited atop the tuned thin film formed in routine 200. It should be noted that the routine 200 is not limited to the process shown in FIG. 7 as various decisions and steps can be omitted, changed, and added. For example, multiple adjustments can be made to oblique incidence angle and/or substrate temperature between steps 208 and 214. Regardless of the manifestation of routine 200, the fabricated thin film is tuned with a uniaxial anisotropy direction, anisotropy strength, and magnetic moment that is optimized for stability, especially in regard to retaining magnetic characteristics after the application of heat. [0044] It can be appreciated that the configuration and material characteristics of the magnetic thin film described in the present disclosure allows for a magnetic layer optimized for anisotropic and thermal stability. The ability to tune the magnetic layer for increased uniaxial anisotropy with oblique incidence angle deposition combines with deposition onto a cryogenically cooled substrate to provide a robust magnetic thin film capable of increasing data bit capacity and data transfer rates of data storage devices. Additionally, it will be appreciated that the claimed technology can readily be utilized in any number of magnetic applications, such as data sensing, data writing, and solid state data storage applications. [0045] It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments, this detailed description is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangements of parts within the principles of the present disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the particular elements may vary depending on the particular application without departing from the scope of the present technology.",

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND [0001] The present invention is related to a magnetic field sensor, and more particularly to a mixed anisotropy magnetoresistive sensor. [0002] Sensors are generally known for measuring the magnitude of a magnetic field based on either giant magnetoresistive (GMR) or tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) materials. These materials are typically made up of two ferromagnetic thin films separated by a non-magnetic spacer. In most applications, one of the magnetic layers is \"pinned,\" holding the orientation of the magnetization of that layer in a fixed direction. The other layer is free to rotate from an equilibrium direction, usually dictated by the coupling between layers as well as the shape in which the magnetic layers are patterned. The degree of deviation of the free layer is proportional to the amount of external field the sensor is exposed to, up to a saturation field (HS). The changes in relative orientations of the magnetizations of the pinned and free layers cause a corresponding change in the measured resistance when current flows through the sensor. FIG. 1 is a graph illustrating this resistance versus applied field curve, with layer orientations inset therein. [0003] If the non-magnetic spacer separating the ferromagnetic thin films is made of a conductive material, the sensor is a GMR sensor. If the non-magnetic spacer separating the ferromagnetic thin films is an insulating material, an added gain in magnetoresistance (MR) change is observed due to quantum mechanical tunneling of spin polarized current, and the sensor is a TMR sensor. SUMMARY [0004] According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus and method as set forth in the appended claims. Other features of the invention will be apparent from the dependent claims, and the description which follows. [0005] The present invention is a mixed anisotropy magnetic field sensor. The sensor includes a first magnetic material film having in-plane anisotropy with a first magnetic easy axis that is in-plane, a second magnetic material film having out-of-plane anisotropy with a second magnetic easy axis that is perpendicular to the first magnetic easy axis of the first magnetic material film, and a non-magnetic spacer between the first magnetic material film and the second magnetic material film. The first magnetic material film has a magnetization oriented in a first magnetization orientation parallel to the first magnetic easy axis in the presence of no applied magnetic field, and the second magnetic material film has a magnetization oriented in a second magnetization orientation parallel to the second magnetic easy axis in the presence of no applied magnetic field. The magnetization of the first magnetic material film rotates to align with the magnetization of the second magnetic material film in the second magnetization orientation in the presence of an applied out-of-plane magnetic field exceeding a threshold, and the magnetization of the second magnetic material film rotates to align with the magnetization of the first magnetic material film in the first magnetization orientation in the presence of an applied in-plane magnetic field exceeding a threshold.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0017] A magnetic field sensor is disclosed herein for measuring the magnitude of magnetic fields potentially in excess of 30 kiloOerstads (kOe) with a linear, non-hysteretic response above approximately 1 kOe. The sensor may be based on either GMR or TMR effects. Combined with one or more low field sensors, possibly on the same die, the linear detection range of a magnetic field sensor can be extended and used for multiple purposes. For example, the low field sensor could be used for compassing while the high field sensor could be used to provide a warning if a high intensity magnetic field is encountered. [0018] Magnetic multilayer films have been constructed and used for sensing of high magnitude magnetic fields, and also as the magnetic media for hard disk drives. In films of this type, the role of the layers involved is different than in a typical GMR or TMR device. The free (magnetically soft) layer of the film is strongly coupled to the pinned (magnetically hard) layer by ferromagnetic exchange coupling. When an electromagnetic is passed over the film, the soft layer assists in switching the hard layer. This can be referred to as a \"pseudo spin-valve\" configuration, since the interlayer coupling of the film affects its switching behavior. In data storage applications, the orientation of the pinned (magnetically hard) layer defines a bit as a '0' or a '1'. The magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer also defines how long a bit may be reliably stored. [0019] The field required to orient the magnetization of the pinned layer of a multilayer film of this type is generally quite high, such as greater than about 20 kOe for well tailored Co/TM (TM (transition metal) = Pt, Pd, Au) materials, and possibly even greater than about 100 kOe for FePtL1o materials. FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating an in-plane major hysteresis loop for a Co/Pd multilayer film that shows the in-plane saturation field at about 25 kOe. [0020] In order to orient the magnetization of the magnetic material layers of the film out-of-plane (OOP), an applied magnetic field must be sufficiently large to overcome the shape anisotropy of the film. The shape anisotropy arises from the magnetostatic energy being minimized in-plane. The shape anisotropy field (the field required to overcome shape effects) is determined by the demagnetization factor (4*\u03c0 for the case of a thin film) multiplied by the film's saturation magnetization (Ms): H k = 4 \u03c0 M s [0021] The typical Ms ranges between 700 emu/cm3 (kA/m) and 1500 emu/cm3 (kA/m), yielding a shape anisotropy field magnitude Hk between 1.9 kG and 8.8 kG for an in-plane material. FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating out-of-plane hysteresis loops for an in-plane film. [0022] A magnetic multilayer film may also be configured with perpendicular (out-of-plane) magnetic anisotropy. This means that the energetically favorable condition is for the magnetization direction (the magnetic easy axis) to point normal to the layers of the film. A perpendicular (out-of-plane) film provides a response to out-of-plane applied magnetic fields that is similar to the response of an in-plane film to in-plane applied magnetic fields, and provides a response to in-plane applied magnetic fields that is similar to the response of an in-plane film to out-of-plane applied magnetic fields. [0023] An interesting aspect of in-plane and perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy films is that the magnetization reversal is typically highly reversible and monotonic except at very low fields (e.g., <1 kG) when a field is applied along the magnetically \"hard\" axis. Therefore, mating an in-plane film with a perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film in a GMR/TMR film stack can provide a means of measuring high magnitude applied films in nearly any direction. The highest field detectable can be tailored by varying the material growth conditions and is limited by the anisotropy field of each magnetic layer. [0024] FIG. 4A is a diagram illustrating the magnetization configuration for mixed anisotropy MR sensor 50 with no applied field (box 52), with an in-plane field applied (boxes 54a and 54b), and with an out-of-plane field applied (boxes 56a and 56b). As shown in box 52, sensor 50 includes in-plane anisotropy film F1 and perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film F2 separated by non-magnetic spacer layer NMS. An in-plane applied magnetic field causes the magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film F2 of sensor 50 to shift to an in-plane magnetization (as illustrated by a transition phase in box 54a and a final phase in box 54b) that is parallel to the magnetization of in-plane anisotropy film F1, and an out-of-plane applied magnetic field causes the magnetization of in-plane anisotropy film F1 of sensor 50 to shift to an out-of-plane magnetization (as illustrated by a transition phase in box 56a and a final phase in box 56b) that is parallel to the magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film F2. [0025] FIG. 4B is a graph illustrating the resulting resistance versus applied field curves of sensor 50. Curve 58 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an in-plane applied field, and curve 59 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an out-of-plane applied field. As can be seen in FIG. 5B, the response of sensor 50 is similar regardless of the field direction, with a linear response region between about 1 kOe and about 10 kOe. This allows sensor 50 to provide a response (a change in resistance) for any direction of applied field, which can be desirable in applications where the field may be applied in any direction with respect to the sensor, such as when the sensor is located in an implanted medical device, for example. [0026] FIG. 5 is a diagram of an exemplary detailed layer configuration of mixed anisotropy MR sensor 60. Similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 4A, sensor 60 is shown in FIG. 5 as including in-plane anisotropy film 62, perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film 64, and non-magnetic spacer layer 66. Non-magnetic spacer layer 66 may be a conducting material (for a GMR sensor) or an insulating material (for a TMR sensor). In-plane anisotropy film 62 includes main in-plane film 62a and interface layer 62b, and perpendicular anisotropy film 64 includes main perpendicular film 64a and interface layer 64b. Interface layers 62b and 64b represent regions where the magnetization, and possibly the film uniformity, are increased compared to main films 62a and 64a. This tends to improve the scattering of spin polarized current. [0027] The out-of-plane anisotropy energy of in-plane anisotropy film 62 is less than 2\u03c0Ms1 2t1, where Ms1 is the saturation magnetization and t1 is the thickness of in-plane anisotropy film 62. The out-of-plane saturation field is defined by NMs1, where N is the shape dependent demagnetization factor. N is equal to 4\u03c0 unless the lateral dimensions of the film are comparable to the thin film thickness. For sensor 60 to operate correctly, the out-of-plane saturation field is greater than the largest desired detectable field. [0028] The out-of-plane anisotropy of perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is greater than 2\u03c0Ms2 2t2, where Ms2 is the saturation magnetization and t2 is the thickness of perpendicular anisotropy film 64. For sensor 60 to operate correctly, the out-of-plane saturation field is smaller than the lowest desired magnetic field to be detected when that field is oriented normal to the film plane of sensor 60, and the in-plane saturation magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is greater than the largest desired magnetic field vector component to be detected in-plane. [0029] In an exemplary embodiment, perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is comprised of [Co/TM]N (where TM=Pd, Pt, Au) multilayers with N repeats of the base bi-layer, FePt or a CrPtMn alloy layer. In an exemplary embodiment, in-plane anisotropy film is comprised of a film such as a [Co/Ni]N multilayer with N repeats of the bilayer or a more traditional MR layer such as a CoFeB/CoFe/NiCoFe trilayer. Non-magnetic spacer layer 66 could consist of Cu for GMR devices or AIO or MgO for TMR devices. [0030] In some embodiments, in-plane anisotropy film 66 and/or perpendicular anisotropy film 64 may be constructed with multiple magnetic and non-magnetic layers. In some embodiments, in-plane anisotropy film 62 and/or perpendicular anisotropy film 64 has increased magnetization (magnetic moment) in a region near non-magnetic spacer layer 66. [0031] FIG. 6 is a diagram of an alternative exemplary detailed layer configuration of mixed anisotropy MR sensor 160. Sensor 160 is similar to sensor 60 shown in FIG. 5, except that multiple films are stacked in the sensor to potentially improve sensor performance by amplifying the response of the sensor and/or tuning the resistance provided by the sensor. In the configuration shown in FIG. 6, sensor 160 includes a stack of films on substrate 161 that includes perpendicular anisotropy film 162, non-magnetic spacer 164, in-plane anisotropy film 166, non-magnetic spacer 168, perpendicular anisotropy film 170, non-magnetic spacer 172, and in-plane anisotropy film 174. Additional films may be added to sensor 160 as well, in the same pattern. [0032] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, perpendicular anisotropy film 162 includes main perpendicular film 162a and interface layer 162b. In-plane anisotropy film 166 includes interface layer 166a, main in-plane film 166b, and interface layer 166c. Perpendicular anisotropy film 170 includes interface layer 170a, main perpendicular film 170b, and interface layer 170c. In-plane anisotropy film 174 includes interface layer 174a and main in-plane film 174b. [0033] In addition to providing a measurement of the magnitude of applied magnetic fields, the sensors disclosed herein can provide a measurement of field direction. FIG. 7 is a graph illustrating magnetoresistance versus applied magnetic field for various tilt angles with respect to the normal of the sensor films. The curves shown in FIG. 7 show the magnetization switching behavior of a sensor for magnetic fields applied azimuthally from the film normal at 0\u00b0 (curve 180), 22.5\u00b0 (curve 182), 45\u00b0 (curve 184), 67.5\u00b0 (curve 186) and 90\u00b0 (curve 188). [0034] The device resistance varies between a minimum resistance (RMinimum ) which occurs when the two film layers' magnetizations are parallel to each other, and a maximum resistance when the magnetizations are anti-parallel. This resistance can be expressed as: R = R Minimum 1 + MR cos 2 M ^ FM 1 - M ^ FM 2 [0035] where M\u0302 FM1 - M\u0302 FM2 is the angle between the magnetizations of the first ferromagnetic film (FM1), which is an in-plane film, and the second ferromagnetic film (FM2), which is an out-of-plane film. MR is the fractional change in resistance when the resistance goes from RMinimum to RMaximum. [0036] Variations in the magnetostatic energy due to different material properties in each of the layers results in the different relative switching behavior of each layer. The switching behavior for a uniformly reversing magnetic film is dictated by the shape and intrinsic anisotropy energies in three dimensions. This energy can be written as: E = - M S H x cos \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + H y sin \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + H z cos \u03d5 + N x M S 2 cos 2 \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + N y M S 2 sin 2 \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + 4 \u03c0 M S 2 cos \u03d5 + K U V sin 2 cos - 1 M \u21c0 \u0095 K \u21c0 / MK [0037] In Equation 3, the first term is the Zeeman energy from the applied magnetic field, the next three terms are the energies related to the geometric patterning/shape of the material and the last term is due to the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the material. In general, for the high field sensor disclosed herein, the in-plane shape anisotropy terms will be significantly small for both layers (smaller than the sensitive range) and can be cancelled leaving: E = - M S H x cos \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + H y sin \u03b8 sin \u03d5 + H z cos \u03d5 + 4 \u03c0 M S 2 cos \u03d5 + K U V sin 2 cos - 1 M \u21c0 \u0095 K \u21c0 / MK [0038] Thus, there is competition between the 4 \u03c0 M S 2 term which constitutes the out-of-plane shape anisotropy and the magnetocrystalline/intrinsic anisotropy term (KuV). For the FM1 type of film, KuV will be in-plane and small compared to the out-of-plane shape anisotropy and can be considered negligible as well when a field is applied out of plane. The FM2 film layer has an out-of-plane component to KuV which is significantly higher than 4\u03c0Ms 2, causing the film's magnetization to prefer to orient normal to the film plane. The different energy landscapes between FM1 and FM2 results in different sensor response as a function of angle with respect to the film normal. Thus, the standalone sensor can serve as an azimuthal angle sensor. [0039] FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a packaging configuration in which multiple high field MR sensors 200, 202 and 204 are packaged on frame 206 in order to improve and fully extend field sensitivity to three dimensions. The thin films of each of sensors 200, 202 and 204 are positioned with their magnetic easy axes oriented orthogonally to each other. This creates unique responses in each of the three sensor directions, and the superposition of these signals allows the magnitude and direction of any applied magnetic field to be measured. [0040] FIGS. 9A, 9B and 9C are diagrams illustrating examples of mixed anisotropy MR sensors constructed of magnetic multilayer films having interlayer coupling that affects switching. Film 220a shown in FIG. 9A includes substrate 222a, seed layer(s) 224a, magnetically \"hard\" Co/Pd pinned multilayer 226, ultrathin Ni layer 228, ultrathin Co layer 229, Cu spacer layer 230, CoFe layer 231, magnetically \"soft\" NiFe free layer 232, CoFe layer 233, Cu spacer layer 234, ultrathin Co layer 235, ultrathin Ni layer 236, magnetically \"hard\" Co/Pd pinned multilayer 238, and capping layer(s) 239a. Layers 226, 228 and 229 are part of a first out-of-plane film, and layers 235, 236 and 238 are part of a second out-of-plane film. Within these films, layers 226 and 238 are the main film layers, and layers 228, 229, 235 and 236 are the interface layers (referring to the terminology introduced in the description of FIGS. 5 and 6 above). Layers 231, 232 and 233 are part of an in-plane film, with layer 232 being the main film layer and layers 231 and 233 being the interface layers. In this configuration, free layer 232 is strongly coupled to pinned layer 226 (and/or to pinned layer 238) by ferromagnetic exchange coupling. In the presence of a magnetic field, free layer 232 assists in switching the magnetization of pinned layer 226 (and/or pinned layer 238). [0041] Film 220b shown in FIG. 9B includes substrate 222b, seed layer(s) 224b, thin Co layer 240, Cu spacer layer 242, thicker Co layer 243, Cu spacer layer 244, thin Co layer 245, Cu spacer layer 246, thicker Co layer 247, Cu spacer layer 248, thin Co layer 249, and capping layer(s) 239b. In this configuration, thicker Co layers 243 and 247 provide films with an in-plane preferred magnetization direction (magnetic easy axis), while thin Co layers 240, 245 and 249 provide films with an out-of-plane preferred magnetization direction (magnetic easy axis), by virtue of the interface anisotropy of the thin Co layers. [0042] Film 220c shown in FIG. 9C includes substrate 222c, seed layer(s) 224c, thin Co layer 250, Cu spacer layer 252, thin Co layer 254, Cu spacer layer 256, thin Co layer 258, Cu spacer layer 260, thin Co layer 262, and capping layer(s) 239c. Film 220c is constructed similarly to film 220b shown in FIG. 9B and described above, in that the material stack is constructed from a Co/Cu multilayer. However, film 220c is made up of Co layers (layers 250, 254, 258 and 262) that all have the same thickness, and which are thin (less than 0.5 nanometers (nm), about 0.3 nm in an exemplary embodiment). This configuration produces a sensor with essentially omnidirectional high field sensitivity. The small thickness of the Co layers likely result in lateral decoupling of the Co layers, because not enough growth has occurred for continuous layers to form. The significantly reduces the impact of the shape anisotropy, while preserving the large interface anisotropy of the Co layers. As a result, the response of each layer is essentially omnidirectional, with the anti-ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Co layers with no applied field, and the layers' gradual ferromagnetic alignment as larger fields are applied, providing this omnidirectional response. [0043] FIG. 10A is a graph illustrating resistance versus applied field curves of sensor film 220a. Curve 270 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an in-plane applied magnetic field, and curve 272 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an out-of-plane applied magnetic field. As can be seen in FIG. 10A, the response of sensor film 220a is similar for both the in-plane and out-of-plane applied magnetic fields, with a linear response region between about 1kOe and about 10kOe (similar to the expected/modeled response shown in FIG. 5B). [0044] FIG. 10B is a graph illustrating resistance versus applied field curves of sensor film 220c. Curve 280 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 0\u00b0 from the normal of film 220c, curve 282 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 45\u00b0 from the normal of film 220c, and curve 284 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 90\u00b0 from the normal of film 220c. As can be seen in FIG. 10B, the response of the sensor to all of these fields is very nearly the same, showing the omnidirecitonal performance of the sensor. [0045] In an exemplary application, a temperature compensating scheme is employed to ensure device stability over a range of temperatures. This may take the form of a Wheatstone bridge where, in low-field sensors, two of the bridge legs are shielded from magnetic fields to provide a common reference. Shielding in this manner is not practical for high-field applications, as the shielding material will saturate in the large fields and provide no immunity to the reference sensor. For the high-field sensors disclosed herein, the symmetry between the in-plane and out-of-plane layers provides a solution to this problem. [0046] The sensors disclosed herein consume relatively low power in comparison to Hall effect sensors, similar to high sensitivity GMR and TMR sensors, and can be manufactured using the same processes as those sensors. It some embodiments, it is possible to have an array of sensors that operate in different ranges on the same die. [0047] The sensors disclosed herein are able to provide a linear response to magnetic fields in a certain range of field magnitudes. For example, the sensor response shown in FIG. 10A shows an in-plane linear response to fields between about 0.5 kilo-Oerstads (kOe) and about 3.5 kOe, and an out-of-plane linear response to fields between about 2 kOe and about 9 kOe. The sensor response shown in FIG. 10B shows a robust, essentially omnidirectional linear response to fields between about 1 kOe and at least about 10 kOe. Thus, one characterization of embodiments of the sensors disclosed herein may be that they provide a linear response to magnetic fields in a range of at least about 3 kOe within a window of field magnitudes between about 0.5 kOe and about 10 kOe. Another characterization of certain embodiments of the sensors disclosed herein may be that they provide a linear response to magnetic fields between about 1 kOe and about 10 kOe. Other characterizations may be made as well, based on the description of exemplary embodiments provided herein. [0048] One example of an application of the sensors disclosed herein is in the medical device industry. Many of the devices used to treat chronic ailments such as heart disease and hearing loss (pacemakers and hearing aids, respectively) possess microelectronics that are highly sensitive to high magnetic fields. This creates a problem, particularly in surgically implanted devices, when a high field is encountered. An example of this is if a patient with a pacemaker needs an MRI, or is in a facility with high field equipment. The sensor disclosed herein would allow for detection of the field and the device could be placed in a \"safe\" mode before damage to the device or to the patient would occur. Other exemplary applications include a low cost detector for experimental and test equipment setups, or field detection in an environment with significant radiation (e.g. space or nuclear plants) due to the radiation hardness of the sensor. There are likely also numerous applications in the defense, security and manufacturing industries where high fields are often present and can be indicators of events such as machine actuation, launches or attempted unauthorized access. [0049] The above description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention occasionally refers to dimensions. It should be understood that references to dimensions herein take normal processing variations into account, whether the term \"about\" is used with the dimension or not, so that dimensions that vary from the particular dimensions described herein within such a processing variation are contemplated by the present disclosure. [0050] While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment(s) disclosed, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. [0051] Attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference.

[0053] Each feature disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings) may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features. [0054] The invention is not restricted to the details of the foregoing embodiment(s).

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) Anisotropy Parameter Estimation TECHNICAL FI ELD The invention relates to the field of estimating elastic anisotropy, and in particular to method of estimating an elastic anisotropy parameter for a geological subsurface. BACKGROUND When modelling the properties of geological subsurfaces, the anisotropy of the subsurfaces must be taken into account. Some subsurfaces are relatively isotropic, but other subsurfaces, such as shale, display anisotropic properties. Failure to take into account the anisotropy of the subsurface can lead to errors and misinterpretation of modelled properties of the geological subsurface. There are different ways to characterize anisotropy. In the field of geophysics, anisotropy of transversal isotropy type, with the vertical axis being the axis of symmetry (TIV), is commonly characterized using Thomsen parameters, as described in Thomsen, L., 1986, \"Weak elastic anisotropy\": Geophysics, 51 , 1954-1966. Thomsen parameters are dimensionless ratios of elastic modulus tensor elements. The Thomsen parameters are: C - C \u03b5 33 (Eq. 1 ) Cij is an elastic modulus tensor (in Voigt notation) that characterizes the elasticity of the medium. The Thomsen parameters typically have a value of less than 1 for layered rock subsurfaces. For some types of subsurface, such as shale, the degree of anisotropy is directly affected by the porosity. This is because, as a shale formation is compacted, porosity decreases and platelets align preferentially, leading to more pronounced anisotropy. Older shale formations therefore tend to exhibit a higher degree of anisotropy than young shale formations. The following equations (Wang, Z., 2002, \"Seismic anisotropy in sedimentary rocks, part 2: Laboratory data\", Geophysics 67, 1423-1440) illustrate how Thomsen parameters can be derived using only porosity: \u03b5 = 0.35486\u03b2-7\u02c7417\u03c6 (Eq. 4) -10.304\u03c6 \u03b3 = 0.4346 le (Eq. 5) where \u03a6 denotes porosity. The porosity \u03a6 in this example was calculated from the weight of samples before and after drying under room temperature. The constants are derived empirically using linear regression on core plug measurements, and are specific to a particular type of lithology (in this case, pure shale). Using this model it is possible to predict \u03b5 and \u03b3 only using porosity. While this model requires only porosity as input to find \u03b5 and \u03b3, it is intended to be used only for pure shale subsurfaces, and the modelled anisotropy has a high degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, the model is not directly related to the volume fraction of clay minerals which is believed to be an important parameter for prediction of anisotropy in shale subsurfaces. A further limitation of this model is that studies on anisotropy estimation from log data have indicated that the elastic anisotropy is not necessarily related to porosity. It is therefore possible that estimating Thomsen parameters using porosity will not always give meaningful results. Hornby B., Howie J.M., and Ince D.W., 2003, \"Anisotropy correction for deviated-well sonic logs: Application to seismic well tie\", Geophysics 68, Vol 68, 464-471 , describes a technique for calculating \u03b5 and \u03b4 when the subsurface in question is not a pure shale, as follows: \u03b5 \u00b0 = V r SH \u03b5c' sh (Eq. 6) Zs and 5Sh are the Thomsen parameters for pure shale and VSH is the volume fraction of shale. If VSH falls below an input reference value, then the rock is assumed to be isotropic. This technique is only claimed to be valid for \u03b5 and \u03b4, but not \u03b3. Furthermore, the model requires calibration from a range of wells with different deviations. In this technique, the anisotropy of the subsurface is proportional to VSH which usually has a value of 1 in a non-reservoir section of a well, including the overburden according to the definition of shale. As various amounts of clay contained in a shale subsurface give rise to anisotropy, even if VSH is equal to one, the clay mineral fraction can be low. SUMMARY It is an object of the invention to provide a way to estimate anisotropy parameters for geological subsurfaces. These may be used in rock physics models where, for example, estimates of the anisotropy parameters cannot be obtained from other sources. According to a first aspect, there is provided a method of estimating a rock physics model anisotropic parameter for a geological subsurface. A volume fraction of dry clay minerals present in the geological subsurface is determined. A total porosity of the geological subsurface is also determined. A value for the anisotropic parameter is determined using the volume fraction of dry clay minerals, the total porosity and empirically derived constants. The anisotropic parameter is optionally a Thomsen \u03b3 parameter, although a similar technique could be used to estimate a different type of anisotropy parameter. In this case, an optional way to estimate the anisotropic parameter is using the equation jrb -C\u00a7t i \u0097 CI V cidry where a, b and c are said empirically derived constants, VC|dry is the volume fraction of dry clay minerals and <t>t is the total porosity. The method optionally further comprises estimating any of Thomsen parameters \u03b5 and \u03b4 using the estimated value of \u03b3 and at least one further empirically derived constant. As an option, the method comprises determining the empirically derived constants using well log data selected from any of refracted shear data, cross-dipole shear data, low frequency Stoneley data and compressional data.

A calibration value for the anisotropic parameter is determined using elastic modulus tensor elements C44 and C66- Any of the empirically derived constants are determined using the determined calibration value of the anisotropic parameter. The empirically derived constants are optionally calibrated using the determined calibration value of the anisotropic parameter by performing a regression. In the event that the empirically derived constants cannot be derived using well log data, default values for the empirically derived constants may optionally be used.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A model is described that can be used to predict anisotropy parameters. In the examples given below, the term anisotropy is used to refer to elastic dynamic vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) anisotropy. Shale subsurfaces are provided as examples of geological subsurfaces to which the model applies, but it will be appreciated that the model may be applied to any type of geological subsurface that displays anisotropic properties. Thomsen parameters, described above, are used as examples of anisotropic parameters that can be predicted. It has been found that the Thomsen parameter \u03b3 can be estimated using the total porosity of the shale subsurface, the volume fraction of dry clay minerals, and empirically derived constants. Furthermore, other Thomsen parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5 for these subsurfaces can be estimated using the estimated value of \u03b3 and further empirically derived constants. A shale subsurface can be characterized as a subsurface having the presence of the following three major components: \u0095 flat particles mainly consisting of (but not limited to) clay mineral platelets; \u02c7 round particles consisting mainly of quartz of silt and/or sand size; and \u0095 porosity. For a fixed clay mineral volume fraction, the relative amount of round particles and the value for porosity may vary. The volume fraction of clay minerals and total porosity are measured or estimated using data from well logs. An estimation of \u03b3 is made according to Equation 8, as follows: y = aVc b ldrye-^' (Eq. 8) where VC|dry is the volume fraction of dry clay minerals, \u03c6( is the total porosity, and a, b and c are constants. The porosity term in Equation 8 accounts for the impact of the variation in porosity on anisotropy. VC|dry and \u03c6( are estimated from log data. Figure 1 illustrates how \u03b3 values increase with increasing values for the volume fraction of dray clay. It can also be seen the \u03b3 values decrease with increasing total porosity. Constants a, b and c vary according to factors such as the type of clay minerals, depth of deposition, age, formation pressure and temperature, and so on. It is therefore desirable to calibrate the model to ensure that a, b and c give an accurate estimate for \u03b3. Calibration is performed locally to the field and/or subsurface that is being investigated, and is discussed in more detail below. It has also been found that \u03b5 and \u03b4 can be estimated directly using the estimated value for Y and further empirically derived constants according to Equations 8 and 9: \u0141 = d (Eq. 9) \u03b4 =ey (Eq. 10) where d and e are further empirically derived constants. Petrophysical practice is typically to estimate a clay index (Vcn) parameter rather than Vcidry- Vcii has a value of 0 for the cleanest sands (because it contains no clay) and 1 for the most clay rich sands. Vd, is often denoted as Vsh (volume fraction shale). However, Vd, is not necessarily related directly to the volume fraction of shale, as the shale may contain silt in addition to clay minerals. In this case, VC|dry can be related to Vcii using Equation 1 1 below: Kldry = f ' Kii (Eq. 1 1 ) where f is a constant that typically has a value of between 0.3 and 0.7. The constant f is typically estimated using, for example, X-ray diffraction analysis where a fraction of clay minerals is found. However, in some circumstances, a direct estimate of dry clay volume fraction can be made. This can be using, for example, advanced logging tools and/or calibration using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis or an equivalent, or knowledge about the clay type that is otherwise obtained. In order to get as accurate an estimation of \u03b3 as possible, the constants can be found by calibrating the model using well log or other available data. There are several different types of data that can be used to estimate values for \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5. By comparing values for \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5 found using well log (or other) data with values obtained using any of Equations 8 to 1 1 , constants a, b, c, d, e and f can be more accurately estimated, typically using a regression procedure such as linear regression. It will be appreciated that in each case, different well log data (such as sonic logs) may be available, and so different well log data can be use to estimate any of \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5 in different ways. The following examples suggest different types of well log data that can be used to estimate values for any of \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5. 1 . Shear data Shear data from vertical wells can be obtained using dipole and/ or refracted shear measurements. These data can, in combination with subsurface density measurements, be used to find the elastic modulus tensor element C44 using Equation 12 below: C44 =pb - Vs 2 v (Eq. 12) where is the bulk density and Vsv is the velocity of a vertically propagating shear wave from a dipole and/or refracted shear wave measurement. Low frequency Stoneley data can be used to find elastic shear stiffness C66 (see for example \"Tang, X., 2001 , \"Determining formation shear-wave transverse isotropy from borehole Stoneley-wave measurements\". Geophysics, 68, 1 18-126). Once C and C66 have been found using well log data, a calculation of \u03b3 can be made using Equation 2. Figure 2 shows an example of \u03b3 at different depths. The graph shows depth in metres, and True Vertical Dept (TVD) from mean sea level in metres. In this case, the values of a, b and c have been calibrated using well log data as described above. VC|dry and \u03a6( are shown. Two plots of \u03b3 are shown; the dotted line shows \u03b3 values that have been estimated using Stoneley wave inversion and dipole data. The solid line shows \u03b3 values that have been estimated using VC|dry and <t>t according to Equation 8. In this case, constant b was adjusted to have a value of 3, whereas default values or constants a and c (1 .3 and 4.5, respectively) were used. The values for \u03b3 estimated using Equation 8 have a good correlation with the values obtained using well log data. The model of Equation 8 can be used subsequently to predict values for \u03b3 in other areas where well log data is not available. 2. Deviated wells For deviated wells having a deviation higher than typically 30-40\u00b0, cross-dipole data can be used to find combinations of \u03b5, \u03b4, and \u03b3, and the vertical compressional slowness (Vp0) and vertical shear slowness (Vs0) for a specific well deviation according to the Thomsen equations shown below as Equations 13. Vp = ^o(l + 5 sin20 cos20 + 8 cos40 ) ^ = ^\u03bf(1 + ^(\u03b5 -\u03b4 ) 8\u03af\u03b7 2 \u03b8 \u03bf\u03bf82 \u03b8 ) (\u0141q 1 3) Vsk = Vs0(l +y sm2 Q ) For example, if Vp, Vsh and Vsv are measured in the same subsurface in two different wells with different well deviations \u0398, this will provide all 5 five parameters involved. In practice, one of the well deviations needs to be sufficiently high to observer anisotropy effects. 3. Compressional slowness Well log data providing compressional slowness values can be used to obtain combinations of \u03b5 , \u03b4 , and Vp0, which can in turn be used to calibrate the values of an of a, b, c, d, e or f. For example if Vp is measured through the same subsurface in three different wells with different well deviation \u0398 the Thomsen equation can be used to find values for the three unknowns Vp0, \u03b4 and \u03b5 . In practice, two of the well deviations need to be significantly high so that anisotropy effects are observed. These two well deviations must also be sufficiently different (20-30 degrees) It will be appreciated that other types of data may be used to calibrate the model of Equations 8 to 1 1 and find accurate values for any of a, b, c, d, e, f. Any combination of such data can be used to contribute to local calibration of the model. In the event that insufficient well log data (or other data) is available to find values for the various constants described above, default values can be used for any or all of the constants a, b, c, d, e and f. Default values for each constant are given in Table 1 . Exemplary ways to estimate these values are as follows: Constants a, b, and c can be estimated by comparing \u03b3 estimation from advanced sonic logs in different vertical wells with model predictions using equation 8 and the constants represents a best overall fit between the two methods. Constants d and e can be obtained from ultrasonic measurements on various core plugs Constant f may be taken as an average dry clay mineral fraction in shales The above ways of estimating values for constants a, b, c, d, e and f are provided by way of example only. It will be appreciated that other techniques may be used to estimate suitable values. Table 1. Default constant values The values for a, b and c given above were used to obtain the \u03b3 values shown in Figure 1 . Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating steps for finding constants according to an embodiment of the invention. The following numbering corresponds to that of Figure 3: S1 . A value of VC|dry is determined for the subsurface. As described above, this may be found directly or using Vcii- 52. A value for (pt is determined for the subsurface. 53. Equation 8 is used to determine \u03b3 using VC|dry, \u03a6\u03b9 and constants a, b and c. 54. If well log data is available, alternative values for \u03b3 are found using the well log data. If the alternative values for \u03b3 closely correspond to the values for \u03b3 determined in step S2, then the process continues at step S6, otherwise the process continues at S5. 55. Any of values a, b and c are amended and the process reverts to step S3. This is typically an iterative process and steps S3 to S5 are repeated until a good correlation between the values of \u03b3 determined using Equation 8 show a good correlation with the alternative values of \u03b3 determined using well log data. 56. If required, values for \u03b5 and \u03b4 are found using the determined values for \u03b3 and constants d and e. S7. The determined values for the Thomsen parameters \u03b3, \u03b4 and/or \u03b5 can then be used in a rock physics model to model the anisotropic subsurface in a region away from the well. Turning now to Figure 4, there is shown a computer apparatus 1 that can be used to implement the procedures described above. The computer apparatus 1 is provided with a processor 2 for performing the calculation and determining any of the constants described above. The processor 2 may be embodied as a single processor are may be embodied as more than one physical processor. In order for the processor 2 to determine values for \u03b3, it requires data. There are several ways that the processor can obtain the data. The computer apparatus 1 may be provided with a user input 3, such as a touch-screen, mouse or keyboard that allows a user to enter data. The computer apparatus 1 may be provided with an input device 4 to receive data. Example of an input device 4 include as a receiver to receive data from a remote source, and an in/out device such as a disk drive. Data may also be stored at a database 5 that, in the embodiment shown in Figure 4 is illustrated as being located at a computer-readable medium in the form of a memory 6. The database 5 may be used to store values for the constants, and any of the other values mentioned above such as \u03b3, \u03a6, \u03b5, \u03b4, and so on, in addition to relevant well log data that can be used for calculating values of \u03b3 and calibrating the constant values. The memory 6 may also be used to store a computer program 7 which, when execute by the processor 2, causes the processor 2 to perform any of the calculations and calibrations described above. A display device 8 may also be provided to present data and results to a user. Alternatively or additionally, an output device 9 may be provided to allow the computer apparatus 1 to output the results of the processing to another device. This may be, for example, a printer. Alternatively, the output device 9 may be a transmitter for sending data to a remote network device. It has been shown that log-derivable estimates for \u03b3 can be obtained using log-derived values for total porosity and for volume fraction of dry clay minerals. Empirically derived constants are used to obtain values for \u03b3, and these constants can be refined to give more accurate values for \u03b3 using well log parameters such as shear and compressional log data, low frequency Stoneley data, and so on. This allows the estimates for \u03b3 to be calibrated locally for a particular subsurface. Furthermore, the estimates for \u03b3 have a direct relation to the other Thomsen anisotropy parameters, \u03b5 and \u03b4, for shale subsurfaces. The estimates of \u03b3 can therefore be used to obtain estimates for \u03b5 and \u03b4. These Thomsen parameters can be use in a rock physics model to model the properties of the geological subsurface or subsurface in question. By precise definition of all input data, the explicit use of the volume of clay minerals, the direct link between all three anisotropy parameters \u03b3, \u03b5 and \u03b4, the techniques described above can be used in a large number of different situations. For example, in a mature field there may be a great deal of data available from well logs which can be used o obtain values for the constants that give very accurate estimates of the Thomsen parameters. New areas of the mature field can therefore be accurately modeled. On the other hand, in exploration areas, where less well log data is available, there may be no other way to estimate the anisotropy parameters. In this case, a reasonable estimate of the anisotropy parameters can be made using a combination of any available data and the default values for shale given in Table 1. It will be appreciated that default values may differ for different regions or different types of anisotropic geological subsurface. It will be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that various modifications may be made to the above described embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, the Thomsen parameters are used as exemplary parameters describing anisotropic parameters of a geological subsurface. However, it will be appreciated that the invention may be applied to finding other types of parameters that can be used to characterise the anisotropy of a geological subsurface. Furthermore, the techniques are described with reference to shale subsurfaces, but it will be appreciated that similar techniques can be applied to other types of anisotropic geological subsurface or subsurface. Certain examples of well log data are provided that can be used to calibrate the constants and improve their accuracy. It will be realised that other types of well log data that are known to have a relationship with any of the anisotropic parameters may also be used when calibrating the values for the constants.",

        "Description": "Description TECHNICAL FIELD Embodiments of the invention are in the field of memory devices and, in particular, a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) for spin transfer torque memory (STTM) devices. BACKGROUND STTM devices are non-volatile memory devices that utilize a phenomenon known as tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR). For a structure including two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating tunnel layer, it is more likely that electrons will tunnel through the tunnel layer when magnetizations of the two magnetic layers are in a parallel orientation than if they are not (non-parallel or antiparallel orientation). As such, an MTJ can be switched between two states of electrical resistance, one state having a low resistance and one state with a high resistance. The greater the differential in resistance, the higher the TMR ratio (RAP\u2212RP/RP*100 where RP and RAP are resistances for parallel and antiparallel alignment of the magnetizations, respectively) and the more readily a bit can be reliably stored in association with the MTJ resistive state. The TMR ratio of a given MTJ is therefore an important performance metric of an STTM. For an STTM device, current-induced magnetization switching is used to set the bit states. Polarization states of one ferromagnetic layer are switched relative to a fixed polarization of the second ferromagnetic layer via the spin transfer torque phenomenon, enabling states of the MTJ to be set by application of current. Upon passing a current through the fixed magnetic layer, angular momentum (spin) of the electrons is polarized along the direction of the magnetization of the fixed layer. These spin polarized electrons transfer their spin angular momentum to the magnetization of the free layer and cause it to precess. As such, the magnetization of the free magnetic layer can be switched by a pulse of current (e.g., in about 1 nano-second) exceeding a certain critical value with magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer remains unchanged as long as the current pulse is below a higher threshold attributable to a different geometry, an adjacent pinning layer, different coercivity (Hc), etc. MTJs with magnetic electrodes having a perpendicular (out of plane of substrate) magnetic easy axis have a potential for realizing higher density memory than in-plane variants. Generally, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) can been achieved in the free magnetic layer in the presence of interfacial perpendicular anisotropy established by an adjacent layer, such as MgO, when free magnetic layer is sufficiently thin. This structure however is associated with greater thermal instability, which can significantly shorten the non-volatile lifetime of a memory element. PMA can also be achieved through coupling to a strongly perpendicular film disposed adjacent to the free layer. While thermal stability is improved with this structure, TMR ratio tends to be low due to crystal mismatch. Perpendicular MTJ structures and formation techniques capable of achieving both a high TMR ratio and good thermal stability are therefore advantageous.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Spin transfer torque memory (STTM) devices with anisotropy enhancing layers and crystallization barrier layers are described. In the following description, numerous details are set forth, however, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, to avoid obscuring the present invention. Reference throughout this specification to \u0093an embodiment\u0094 or \u0093in one embodiment\u0094 means that a particular feature, structure, function, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase \u0093in an embodiment\u0094 in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, functions, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, a first embodiment may be combined with a second embodiment anywhere the two embodiments are not specified to be mutually exclusive.

For example, one layer disposed over (above) or under another layer may be directly in contact with the other layer or may have one or more intervening layers. Moreover, one layer disposed between two layers may be directly in contact with the two layers or may have one or more intervening layers. In contrast, a first layer \u0093on\u0094 a second layer is in direct contact with that second layer. Similarly, unless explicitly stated otherwise, one feature disposed between two features may be in direct contact with the adjacent features or may have one or more intervening features. In embodiments, an STTM device includes at least one magnetic anisotropy enhancing layer (AEL) separated from an MTJ by a crystallization barrier layer. FIG. 1A illustrates a cross-sectional view of a material layer stack 101 for one such STTM device, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The material layer stack 101 is formed over a substrate thin film layer 100, preferably amorphous, such as, but not limited to silicon dioxide or comparable dielectric. The stack 101 generally includes a first contact metallization 105, an MTJ STRUCTURE 103, a magnetic anisotropy enhancing layer (AEL) 120, a crystallization barrier layer 112 disposed there between, and a second contact metallization 130. Notably, the order of the material layers disposed between the metallization layers 105, 130 may be inverted as is illustrated in FIG. 1B providing a cross-sectional view of a material layer stack 102, in accordance with another embodiment. Layers depicted in FIG. 1B having a same function and material properties as those in FIG. 1A are identified with a same reference number. As shown for the stack 102, the AEL 120 is on the first contact metallization 105 with the crystallization barrier layer 112 disposed on the AEL 120 and the MTJ STRUCTURE 103 disposed over the crystallization barrier layer 112. The contact metallization layers 105 and 130 are each of a material or stack of materials operable for electrically contacting magnetic electrodes of a STTM device, and may be any material or stack of materials known in the art for such a purpose. Although the metallization layers 105, 130 may have a range of thicknesses (e.g., 5 nm-50 nm) and include a variety of materials to form a compatible interface with both the STTM device and interconnects, in the exemplary embodiment the interconnect metallization 105 includes at least a tantalum (Ta) layer 105C and is illustrated with an additional underlying conductive buffer further including at least one ruthenium (Ru) layer 105B and a second Ta layer 105A. For the capping metallization 130, a metal having high conductivity even if oxidized at the surface is advantageous, such as, but not limited to, Cu, Al, Ru, Au, etc, with Ru advantageously providing a good barrier of oxygen, reducing the possibility of oxidation within the MTJ STRUCTURE 103. As further illustrated, disposed over the contact metallization 105 is an out-of-plane, or \u0093perpendicular,\u0094 anisotropic epitaxial MTJ structure 103 including the fixed magnetic layer 106, tunneling layer 108, and free magnetic layer 110. Generally, the fixed magnetic layer 106 is composed of a material or stack of materials suitable for maintaining a fixed magnetization direction while the free magnetic layer 110 is composed of a magnetically softer material or stack of materials (i.e. magnetization can easily rotate to parallel and antiparallel state with respect to fixed layer). The tunneling layer 108 is composed of a material or stack of materials suitable for allowing current of a majority spin to pass through the layer, while impeding current of a minority spin (i.e., a spin filter). This enhances the tunneling magneto-resistance of the MTJ device. In the exemplary embodiment, the MTJ structure 103 is based on a CoFeB/MgO system, having an MgO tunneling layer 108 and CoFeB layers 106, 110 all with (001) out-of-plane texture, where texture refers to the distribution of crystallographic orientations within in the layers of the MTJ structure. For embodiments described herein, a high percentage of crystals of the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB structure 103 have the preferred (001) out-of-plane orientation (i.e., the degree of texture is high) for a TMR ratio of at least 100%. In one advantageous CoFeB/MgO embodiment, the (001) oriented CoFeB magnetic layers 106, 108 are iron-rich alloys (i.e., Fe>Co), such as, but not limited to, Co20Fe60B20. In one such embodiment, both the fixed and free magnetic layers have an as-deposited composition of Co20Fe60B20 with some loss of B occurring during solid phase epitaxial process occurring at elevated temperature (i.e., anneal) to transition to a desired bcc (001) texture from as-deposited amorphous or isotropic (non-textured) material states. As such, the magnetic layers 106 and 110 are best characterized as having \u009820% Boron. Other embodiments with equal parts cobalt and iron are also possible (e.g., Co40Fe40B20), as are lesser amounts of iron (e.g., Co70Fe10B20). In still other embodiments the tunneling layer 108 composition serves as a suitable texture template but is other than MgO, for example aluminum oxide (AlOx). The tunneling layer 108 may have a thickness up to 2 nm, however resistance for a given device area generally increases exponentially with tunneling layer thickness. In exemplary MgO embodiments thicknesses below 1 nm provide advantageously low resistance with thickness between 1 nm and 1.3 nm also providing acceptably low resistance. Thickness of the fixed magnetic layer 106 may also vary considerably, for example between 1 nm and 2 nm. In embodiments, the thickness of the free magnetic layer 110 is over 1 nm (e.g., at least 1.1 nm) and exemplary iron-rich CoFeB embodiments of the free magnetic layer 110 have a thickness between 1.3 nm and 2 nm. This greater thickness improves thermal stability of the free magnetic layer 110, enabling longer non-volatile lifetimes of an STTM device relative to a free magnetic layer of lesser thickness (e.g., 1 nm, or less, for those systems relying interfacial anisotropy alone). Although for the exemplary embodiment, the MTJ STRUCTURE 103 is disposed directly one the contact metallization 105 (e.g., with CoFeB fixed magnetic layer 106 directly on a Ta layer), it is noted an MTJ stack may vary considerably below the tunneling layer 108 without deviating from the scope of the embodiments of the present invention. For example, one or more intermediate layer may be disposed between the fixed magnetic layer 106 and adjacent contact metallization 105. For example, an anti-ferromagnetic layer, such as, but not limited to, iridium manganese (IrMn) or platinum manganese (PtMn), or a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) structure including such an anti-ferromagnetic layer, adjacent to another ferromagnetic layer (e.g., CoFe) with a nonmagnetic spacer layer, such as, but not limited to Ru, intervening between the fixed magnetic layer 106 and the SAF, may be present for various purposes, such as pinning an interface of the fixed magnetic layer 106 (e.g., through exchange-bias coupling). As another example of variation in MTJ stack variation below the tunneling layer, the fixed magnetic layer 106 may further include a half-metallic material (e.g., Heusler alloy) at the interface with the tunneling layer 108. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the stack 101 further includes the AEL 120. The AEL 120 may be a material layer or stack of material layers (represented by dashed lines in FIG. 1A) that couples to the free magnetic layer 110 to promote out-of-plane alignment within the free magnetic layer 110 of the greater thicknesses (i.e., greater than 1 nm) described elsewhere herein. For example, in one advantageous embodiment, the AEL 120 promotes out-of-plane alignment within an iron-rich CoFeB free magnetic layer 110 having a thickness of between 1.3 nm and 2.0 nm. FIG. 2A illustrates an expanded cross-sectional view of an exemplary material stack 201 that includes multi-layered magnetic AEL 120 disposed over a portion of a perpendicular MTJ stack, which is employed in an STTM device in accordance with an embodiment. As shown in FIG. 2A, the AEL 120 is a bi-layer alternating between a magnetic material layer 121 and a non-magnetic material layer 122. With each bi-layer A, B, C, D, and E of the multi-layered AEL 120 representing one repetition, for five repeats or cycles, although such a bi-layer AEL may include 2 to 20 repetitions. In embodiments, the magnetic material layer 121 is composed of a ferromagnetic material, such as, but not limited to Co, Ni, Fe, or alloys thereof, with the exemplary embodiment being Co. Thickness of each magnetic material layer 121A, 121B, etc. may range between 0.2 and 2 nm. The non-magnetic material layer 122 may be composed of a non-magnetic metal, advantageously a noble metal such as, but not limited, to palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), Ru, Au, or Ir, with the exemplary embodiment being Pd. Thickness of each non-magnetic material layer 122A, 122B, etc., is generally less than 2 nm, and more specifically between 0.2 nm and 2 nm for the exemplary Pd embodiment. Material layers with the AEL 120 may be strained with one or more of layers in the AEL 120 having fcc (111) orientation. The inventors have found that while the presence of the AEL 120 advantageously enhances out-of-plane anisotropy of the free magnetic layer 110, crystal texture within the free magnetic layer 110 may tend to align to the crystal lattice of the layers with the AEL 120, rather than aligning to the tunneling layer 108 as a template in absence of the AEL 120. Such templating from the AEL 120 disadvantageously reduces the TMR ratio of a given stack. As the non-magnetic layer materials in the AEL generally have fcc (111) orientation, in the exemplary embodiment the magnetic material layer 121 is deposited in closest proximity to the free magnetic layer 110 (i.e., deposited before the non-magnetic material layer 122), which has been found to reduce the deleterious effect of the non-magnetic material with respect to out-of-plane anisotropy. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, the magnetic material layer 121A is deposited directly on the crystallization barrier layer 112. In embodiments of the present invention, the STTM device layer stack 101 further includes the crystallization barrier layer 112 between the AEL 120 and the free magnetic layer 110. One function of the crystallization barrier layer 112 is to improve crystal alignment between the free magnetic layer 110 and the tunneling layer 108. It has been found that insertion of the crystallization barrier layer 112, when of proper microstructure, promotes much better grain alignment between the exemplary MgO tunneling layer 108 and a Fe-rich CoFeB free magnetic layer 110 than would otherwise occur in absence of a crystallization barrier. Although not bound by theory, it is currently thought that the crystallization barrier reduces or prevents templating of the free magnetic layer off the AEL 120, particularly where a non-magnetic fcc material is deposited first within the AEL 120. In embodiments, the crystallization barrier layer 112 has either bcc or amorphous structure to best promote bcc (001) structure within the CoFeB free magnetic layer 110. The barrier, at least reduces conflicting crystallization even where the barrier is amorphous, and if bcc (001) may further serve as a second templating surface, in addition to that provided by the tunneling layer (e.g., MgO). In further embodiments, the crystallization barrier layer 112 is of a material, or stack of materials that provides sufficient direct or indirect magnetic coupling between the free magnetic layer 110 and the AEL 120 to achieve PMA within the free magnetic layer 110. In advantageous embodiments, the crystallization barrier layer 112 is further of a material offering good solubility of boron and/or offering a low boron alloy temperature, to advantageously absorb boron during a post-deposition anneal, thereby reducing the presence of boron at the interface between the free magnetic layer 110 and the tunneling layer 108 (e.g., CoFeB/MgO interface), again theorized to promote optimal crystallization during solid phase epitaxy of the free magnetic layer 110. As such, in embodiments, detectable levels of boron are present in the crystallization barrier layer 112 even where an as-deposited composition of the barrier layer does not. In embodiments, the as-deposited crystallization barrier layer 112 composition includes at least one of: Ta, Ru, tungsten (W), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), or chromium (Cr). In certain such embodiments, the crystallization barrier layer 112 is composed of one of: Ta, Ru, tungsten (W), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), or chromium (Cr) with Ta being an advantageous embodiment with relatively high boron solubility at moderate anneal temperatures (e.g., 300-350\u00b0 C.). Generally, the thickness of the crystallization barrier layer 112 is dependent on the exchange-coupling strength (Jex) of the crystallization barrier layer 112, as well as the uniaxial anisotropy (Ku) of the AEL 120 with a higher Jex (mJ/m2) and a higher Ku (MJ/m3) enabling a greater barrier layer thickness for a given magnetic angle out of plane (90\u00b0 being perpendicular). A barrier layer composed of materials having high spin orbit-coupling (generally composed of elements of high atomic number) can be expected to be thinner than those with low spin orbit-coupling because high spin-orbit coupling reduces the exchange coupling strength. This can be seen in the FIG. 3A, where the angle of magnetization (M) in CoFeB (90 degrees being perpendicular) for barrier layer materials of different exchange-coupling strength (Jex of \u22121, \u22121.5, and \u22122.5 mJ/m2) is plotted as function of uniaxial anisotropy (Ku). This simulation demonstrates the effect of barrier layer thickness by calculating the magnetization angle of CoFeB for different exchange coupling strength between CoFeB (1.6 nm) and the AEL. The exchange coupling strength is known to decrease with increasing barrier thickness. The plot also shows that uniaxial anisotropy (Ku) of the AEL larger than 2 MJ/m3 ensures magnetization of CoFeB is fully perpendicular. In embodiments employing the exemplary barrier materials described elsewhere herein, the barrier thickness is between 0.1 nm and 1.3 nm. FIG. 3B illustrates plots of the resistance due to the extraordinary Hall Effect (EHE) as a function of magnetic field for a partial MTJ stack, illustrating the effect of thickness for the exemplary Ta crystallization barrier layer 112. For the EHE measurements, a partial MTJ stack including a 1.2 nm layer of CoFeB on a 1 nm layer of MgO is disposed over a silicon dioxide substrate layer. The CoFeB is separated from an AEL composed of five bilayers of 0.3 nm Co and 1.0 nm Pd by an exemplary Ta barrier layer having 0.3 nm, 0.7 nm and 1.0 nm thickness. As shown for the 1.0 nm treatment, the loop displays considerable upward slope 312 indicating the presence of in-plane magnetization within the CoFeB layer associated with a loss of coupling to the AEL. The 0.7 nm Ta barrier layer thickness however displays good squareness indicative of highly out-of-plane anisotropy and 0.3 nm Ta appearing slightly better still. As such, for an exemplary Ta embodiment of the crystallization barrier layer 112, the Ta barrier layer thickness is 0.7 nm, or less. Other barrier materials may of course be associated with other threshold thickness where coupling to the AEL becomes insufficient. To disrupt disadvantageous templating off the AEL 120, the crystallization barrier layer 112 need only provide an interface in contact with free magnetic layer 110 having microstructure that promotes the desired post-anneal structure (e.g., CoFeB bcc (001) texture), and so barrier thickness can be minimal. However, in certain embodiments barrier layer thickness is maximized to the extent constrained by the degree of out-of-plane anisotropy of the free magnetic layer 110 (i.e., constrained by coupling to AEL) so as to enhance the ability of the barrier layer bulk to sink boron. As such, for a Ta barrier embodiment, a 0.7 nm embodiment may be advantageous has having the ability to absorb more boron than a 0.3 nm embodiment. As a barrier layer may promote a desired crystallization within the free magnetic layer 110 through multiple mechanisms (e.g., interfacial template and bulk boron absorption), in further embodiments, the crystallization barrier layer 112 is a multi-layered stack amenable to separate optimization of the interfacial and bulk properties of the barrier. FIG. 2B illustrates an expanded cross-sectional view of a material stack 202 including a crystallization barrier layer 112 further divided into a first crystallization barrier layer 112A disposed on the free magnetic layer 110 and a second crystallization barrier layer 112B disposed on the first crystallization barrier layer 112A. For the first crystallization barrier layer 112A, advantageous interfacial microstructure is useful and any of the materials described elsewhere herein in the context of the crystallization barrier layer 112 (e.g., Ta) may be utilized to this end. The thickness of the first crystallization barrier layer 112A may further be advantageously minimized. For the second crystallization barrier layer 112B, bulk properties advantageous with respect to boron absorption are useful with those materials further having lower spin orbit-coupling than that of the first crystallization barrier layer 112A being highly advantageous as permitting a greater thickness of the second barrier layer 112B and therefore greater boron absorption. In embodiments, the second crystallization barrier layer 112B has a thickness at least equal to that of the first crystallization barrier layer 112B. The combined thickness of a multi-layered barrier may be greater than that of a single material layer crystallization barrier embodiment. For example, whereas a single material layer barrier composed of Ta may be limited in layer thickness to about 0.7 nm (as shown in FIG. 3A), in a multi-layered embodiment a second barrier layer of a thickness greater than 0.4 nm (e.g., 0.6-0.8 nm) may be deposited on a first crystallization barrier layer 112A of Ta having a thickness of 0.3 nm (or less) while still achieving the level of out-of-plane anisotropy depicted in FIG. 3A for the 0.7 nm Ta barrier layer. The material(s) for the second crystallization barrier layer 112B, distal from the free magnetic layer interface, has a greater degree of freedom to be one which can sink boron (enhancing solid phase epitaxy of the free magnetic layer 110) and potentially possess lower spin orbit-coupling than do materials offering an optimal interfacial microstructure. Generally, the second crystallization barrier layer 112B may be composed of any conductive material which alloy reasonably well with boron, preferably those of low mass number. In embodiments, the second crystallization barrier layer 112B has other than bcc or amorphous structure, such as, but not limited to fcc, hcp, or tetragonal structure. In exemplary embodiments, the second crystallization barrier layer 112B comprises Cu, V, Cr, Rh, Ir, Ru. FIG. 3C illustrates a plot of TMR ratio for a perpendicular MTJ stack including a barrier layer disposed between an AEL and MTJ in accordance with an embodiment in comparison an MTJ stack lacking a barrier layer. A normalized TMR ratio (%) is plotted as a function of magnetic field in milliTesla (mT) for two MTJ stacks which are substantially the same except for the presence of a Ta barrier layer. As shown, for an exemplary iron-rich CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/[Co/Pd]x5 stack, the addition of a 0.3 nm Ta barrier between the CoFeB and [Co/Pd]x5 improves TMR by \u0098100%. In exemplary embodiments, the stacks 101, 102, 201, and 202, are all formed through physical vapor deposition (PVD). One or more of co-sputter and reactive sputtering may be utilized in any capacity known in the art to form the various layer compositions described herein. After one or more of the layers (e.g., all layers) in the stacks 101, 102, 201, or 202 are deposited, an anneal is performed under any conditions known in the art to promote solid phase epitaxy of the free magnetic layer 110 following the template crystallinity of the tunneling layer 108 (e.g., MgO). Anneal temperatures, durations, and environments vary with specific embodiments performing an anneal at 250\u00b0 C., or more. It is understood that the steps for fabrication further include standard microelectronic fabrication processes such as lithography, etch, thin films deposition, planarization (e.g., CMP), and/or any other processing commonly employed in microelectronic component fabrication to complete delineation and interconnection of an STTM device employing any of the stacks 101, 102, 201, and 202, or a subset of the material layers therein. FIG. 4 illustrates a schematic of a spin transfer torque memory bit cell 600 which includes a spin transfer torque element 610, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The spin transfer torque element 610 includes: a free magnetic layer metallization 612; a free magnetic layer 614 proximate to the free magnetic layer metallization 611 with a magnetic anisotropy enhancement layer 612 and barrier layer 613 disposed there between; a fixed magnetic layer metallization 616 proximate to a fixed magnetic layer 618; and a tunneling layer 622 disposed between the free magnetic layer 614 and the fixed magnetic layer 618, to complete the MTJ structure 626. A first dielectric element 623 and a second dielectric element 624 is disposed adjacent the fixed magnetic layer electrode 616, the fixed magnetic layer 618, and the tunneling layer 622. The fixed magnetic layer electrode 616 is electrically connected to a bit line 632. The free magnetic layer electrode 6112 is connected to a transistor 634. The transistor 634 is connected to a word line 636 and a source line 638 in any manner conventional in the art. The spin transfer torque memory bit cell 600 may further include additional read and write circuitry (not shown), a sense amplifier (not shown), a bit line reference (not shown), and the like, as will be understood by those skilled in the art of solid state non-volatile memory devices, for the operation of the spin transfer torque memory bit cell 600. It is to be understood that a plurality of the spin transfer torque memory bit cell 600 may be operably connected to one another to form a memory array (not shown), wherein the memory array can be incorporated into a non-volatile memory device.

In the exemplary embodiment, the device 710 includes at least one memory at least one processor chip (e.g., a multi-core microprocessor and/or graphics processor cores 730, 731). In embodiments, an STTM 732, as described in more detail elsewhere herein (e.g., FIGS. 1A, 4, etc.), is integrated into the device 710. The device 710 is further coupled to the board, substrate, or interposer 500 along with, one or more of a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) 715, RF (wireless) integrated circuit (RFIC) 725 including a wideband RF (wireless) transmitter and/or receiver (e.g., including a digital baseband and an analog front end module further comprises a power amplifier on a transmit path and a low noise amplifier on a receive path), and a controller thereof 711. Functionally, the PMIC 715 performs battery power regulation, DC-to-DC conversion, etc., and so has an input coupled to the battery 713 and with an output providing a current supply to all the other functional modules. As further illustrated, in the exemplary embodiment the RFIC 725 has an output coupled to an antenna to provide to implement any of a number of wireless standards or protocols, including but not limited to Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 family), WiMAX (IEEE 802.16 family), IEEE 802.20, long term evolution (LTE), Ev-DO, HSPA+, HSDPA+, HSUPA+, EDGE, GSM, GPRS, CDMA, TDMA, DECT, Bluetooth, derivatives thereof, as well as any other wireless protocols that are designated as 3G, 4G, 5G, and beyond.

        "Description": "Description CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/873,101 filed Sep. 3, 2013, and entitled \u0093System and Method for Estimating Seismic Anisotropy with High Resolution,\u0094 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND Anisotropy is the variation of a physical property depending on the direction in which the property is measured. Anisotropy is a common phenomenon in various scientific fields, such as medical science, physics, and engineering. In the field of geophysics, anisotropy most often refers to seismic anisotropy. Seismic anisotropy is the dependence of seismic velocity upon angle, and can arise from intrinsic anisotropy of the rock itself, or from stress-induced anisotropy caused by a difference of directional stresses in formation layers. The application of seismic anisotropy has substantially improved the exploration of hydrocarbons, by modifying the velocity model from simple isotropic to more realistic anisotropic. Seismic anisotropy has played a role in applications such as long offset seismic data with greater angles of incidence (the angle-dependence of velocity is more evident), AVO (Amplitude versus offset) quantitative analysis, and anisotropic imaging (migration). SUMMARY A system and method for high resolution estimation of seismic anisotropy are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, a method for determining anisotropy parameters of subsurface formations includes generating a synthetic reflectivity gather from a vertical well log. Times of a surface seismic gather are adjusted to those of the synthetic gather. Low-cut filtering is applied to the surface seismic gather. Anisotropy parameters are generated as a difference of the filtered seismic gather and the synthetic gather. An anisotropy value is assigned to each of plurality of layers of a formation based on the generated anisotropy parameters. In another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium is encoded with instructions that are executable to cause a processor to generate a synthetic reflectivity gather from a vertical well log, and to adjust times of a surface seismic gather to those of the synthetic gather. The instructions also cause the processor to low-cut filter the surface seismic gather, and generate anisotropy parameters as a difference of the filtered seismic gather and the synthetic gather. The instructions further cause the processor to assign an anisotropy value to each of plurality of layers of a formation based on the generated anisotropy parameters. In a further embodiment, a system for determining anisotropy parameters of subsurface formations includes a processor and anisotropy extraction instructions. The anisotropy extraction instructions configure the processor to generate a synthetic reflectivity gather from a vertical well log, and to adjust the times of a surface seismic gather to those of the synthetic gather. The anisotropy extraction instructions also configure the processor to low-cut filter the surface seismic gather, and to generate anisotropy parameters as the difference of the filtered seismic gather and the synthetic gather. The anisotropy extraction instructions further configure the processor to assign an anisotropy value to each of plurality of layers of a formation based on the generated anisotropy parameters.

Except where otherwise noted, \u0093anisotropy\u0094 is yet further specified to be measured by the parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5, as defined in Leon Thomsen, Weak Elastic Anisotropy, 51 GEOPHYSICS 1954 (1986). The recitation \u0093based on\u0094 is intended to mean \u0093based at least in part on.\u0094 Therefore, if X is based on Y, X may be based on Y and any number of other factors. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to that embodiment. In oil and gas contexts, shale is commonly the lithology with the most significant anisotropy. A method of directly obtaining anisotropy parameters of shale involves measuring the shale sample in a laboratory, using, for example, acoustic travel time measurements in various directions. However, under lab conditions, the frequencies applied (ultrasonic) are different from those of seismic waves, and the state of stress may be different from that in the subsurface, so the rocks may not exhibit the same anisotropy as when underground. More fundamentally, the sample necessarily constitutes only a small portion of the subsurface formation, and so any measurement on the sample may or may not be representative of a larger volume. An in-situ measurement, at appropriate scale, is preferable. Other conventional methods to measure anisotropy use surface seismic data and Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) data, using in particular the arrival times of various identifiable reflections. These seismic arrival-time methods, such as those which measure vertical, hyperbolic, and non-hyperbolic \u0093moveout\u0094, produce estimates of anisotropy which have low spatial resolution, and therefore cannot be used in AVO studies, which can have much higher spatial resolution. Given a borehole of sufficient depth, and a co-located Common Depth Point (\u0093CDP\u0094) gather of surface seismic data, the anisotropy parameter \u03b4 may be determined, with low resolution in vertical time t0, by comparison of the (seismic band) vertical velocity VP0seis (e.g. from a VSP) with the moveout velocity VNMO (from the CDP gather): V NMO(t 0)=V P0Seis(t 0)(1+\u03b4(t 0))\u2003\u2003(1) However, if performed with excessively fine resolution in t0, this calculation becomes numerically unstable. The method and system disclosed herein remedy this situation by using seismic and sonic amplitudes. Anisotropy logging, or cross-dipole logging, is another known technique for measuring anisotropy. This type of log uses two dipole transmitters perpendicular to each other, and arrays of two dipole receivers, similarly oriented, and measures fast and slow shear-slowness and fast-shear azimuth. This method is disadvantageous in that it is highly dependent on the borehole environment, and has dispersion characteristic of dipole flexural waves. More fundamentally, it measures azimuthal shear-wave velocity, whereas the present disclosure estimates polar P-wave anisotropy. Those skilled in the art will understand that shear waves are polarized mainly perpendicular to their direction of propagation, whereas P-waves are polarized mainly parallel to their direction of propagation, and that \u0093azimuthal anisotropy\u0094 refers to variation of velocity with respect to the azimuthal angle, whereas \u0093polar anisotropy\u0094 refers to variation of velocity with respect to the polar angle (e.g. from the vertical). Embodiments of the present disclosure extract seismic polar anisotropy parameters, with the vertical resolution of the seismic wavelet, from prestack surface seismic data and vertical well logs. The method uses sonic VP0, VS0, and \u03c1 (from logs), convolved with the (zero-phase) seismic wavelet from a co-located surface CDP gather) to construct an isotropic synthetic reflectivity gather. This synthetic gather contains only those propagation effects which are encoded in that seismic wavelet. The seismic data is adjusted, in ways known to those skilled in the art, and described further below. The jump in anisotropy parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5 at each major reflector in the logged interval is derived from the arithmetic difference between the adjusted seismic amplitudes and the isotropic synthetic amplitudes. Integration of these differences, starting at a sandstone layer (with anisotropy assumed zero), yields a profile of the anisotropy. Embodiments begin by processing log data, for vertical velocities VP0, VS0, and density \u03c1, recorded and quality-controlled in ways familiar to those skilled in the art, in a vertical borehole penetrating horizontal formations with assumed polar anisotropic symmetry. If the borehole is not vertical, or if the formations are not horizontal, the present embodiment may be modified accordingly, by one skilled in the art. If VS0 is not measured, it may be estimated, with corresponding reduction in confidence of the resulting computation. The depths are converted to vertical travel times using methods known in the art. At every logged point, and for a variety of assumed polar angles of incidence \u03b8, a linearized isotropic reflection coefficient may be computed. (E.g.

Embodiments apply a co-located CDP gather of surface seismic data, using methods known in the art. The gather may be processed (pre-stack) to eliminate multiples and other noise, and converted to the angle domain. The gather should not be migrated, unless the migration algorithm which is applied preserves relative amplitudes well. A super-gather may be used to increase signal/noise. The gather may be time-shifted and stretched/compressed in time to tie the synthetic gather (equation (3)). The gather may be transformed to zero phase, and a wavelet w(t0) may be extracted. The gather may be filtered so that this wavelet is independent of incidence angle. The wavelet is convolved with the reflectivity (equation (1)) to yield a flattened synthetic isotropic reflectivity gather: S syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) \ue89e \u2261 w \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) * R iso \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) \ue89e = A syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) + B syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 + C syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 \ue89e \ue89e tan 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 , \ue89e \ue89e where ( 4 ) A syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \u2261 w \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) * A iso \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) B syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \u2261 w \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) * B iso \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) C syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \u2261 w \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) * C iso \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) ( 5 ) are computed quantities. Apart from propagation effects expressed by the seismic wavelet, there are no other propagation effects in ssyn. The \u0093convolutional model\u0094 of scalar seismic wave propagation describes this gather as: s seis(t,\u03b8)=C(t,\u03b8)*I(t,\u03b8)*P \u2191(t,\u03b8)*r(t,\u03b8)*P \u2193(t,\u03b8)*w 0 (t)*S 0 (\u03b8),\u2003\u2003(6) which recounts the history of the wave, right-to-left. The operators shown above (discussed below) show an explicit dependence on the incidence wavefront-angle \u03b8 at the eventual reflector, with an implicit dependence on the local ray-angle along the raypath. Since the operators depend upon frequency, and the frequency components combine linearly, the operations combine as convolutions. The source-strength S0(\u03b8) includes the intrinsic source directivity, and also the interaction with the free surface (ghost, etc.). The time-signature of the source is given by the initial wavelet w0(t). The downward-propagating operator P\u2193(\u03b8,t) includes the effects of geometric spreading, attenuation, transmission coefficients, \u0093friendly multiples\u0094, focusing/defocussing, etc. The reflectivity series r(\u03b8,t) is discussed below. The upward-propagating operator P\u2191(\u03b8,t) includes the same effects as P\u2193(\u03b8,t) but driven by the properties of the local medium on the upward leg of the ray. The instrumental operator I(\u03b8,t) includes the instrumental impulse response, including coupling effects, as well as the interaction with the free surface at the receiver location. The computational operator C(\u03b8,t) includes any processing that may have been done on the data. Embodiments augment C(\u03b8,t) to include time-flattening of the gather, and since convolution commutes, re-arrange equation (6) as S seis \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) = [ C \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) * I \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) * P \u2191 \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) * P \u2193 \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) * S 0 \ue8a0 ( \u03b8 ) * w 0 \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) ] * r \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) = [ P \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) * w \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) ] * r \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) ( 7 ) where the propagation operator P(t0,\u03b8) is compact notation for all the operators included in the square bracket above, and where w(t0) is the observed seismic wavelet. Embodiments assume that the reflectivity series r(t0,\u03b8) is the linearized plane-wave P-reflectivity for polar anisotropic media: r(t 0,\u03b8)\u2261R aniso(t 0,\u03b8)\u2245A aniso +B aniso sin2 \u03b8+C aniso sin2 \u03b8 tan2 \u03b8,\u2003\u2003(8) with A anis(t 0)=A iso(t 0) B aniso(t 0)=B iso(t 0)+\u0394\u03b4(t 0)/2 C aniso(t 0)=C iso(t 0)+\u0394\u03b5(t 0)/2.\u2003\u2003(9) In analogy with equations (4) and (8), embodiments parameterize the angular variation of the seismic data (equation (7)) with s seis(t 0,\u03b8)=[A seis(t 0)+B seis(t 0)sin2 \u03b8+C seis(t 0)sin2 \u03b8 tan2 \u03b8].\u2003\u2003(10) Embodiments may proceed with the analysis either in terms of band-limited (\u0093wiggle\u0094) traces, or as discrete (\u0093sparse-spike\u0094) reflectivity impulses. Considering now, an embodiment using discrete reflectivity impulses: \u00c2 seis(t 0)\u2261w* seis(t 0) {circumflex over (B)} seis(t 0)\u2261w* seis(t 0) \u0108 seis(t 0)\u2261w* seis(t 0).\u2003\u2003(11) The impulse functions seis(t0), seis(t0), seis(t0) may be found manually or by sparse-spike inversion; and occur only at times t0 for which a correlative event occurs in the isotropic synthetic gather of equation (4). The spikes represent the central peaks (or troughs) of each major event in the zero-phase data, over the logged interval, as a function of angle \u03b8, seis(t0), seis(t0), seis(t0) are found as best fits to these data, of the Aki-Richards form: [ seis + seis sin2 \u03b8+ seis sin2 \u03b8 tan2 \u03b8].\u2003\u2003(12) Embodiments apply standard statistical measures to test the confidence with which the low-order terms seis(t0), seis(t0) are determined. If the seismic data is too noisy, then either or both is poorly determined, and the analysis of such terms should not proceed. With this subset of events, the resulting reduced seismic gather is written as: s ^ seis \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) = \u03a3 t 0 \ue8a0 [ A ^ seis \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) + B ^ seis \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 + C ^ seis \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 \ue89e \ue89e tan 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 ] ( 13 ) where only the selected events are included in the sum, and \u00c2seis(t0), {circumflex over (B)}seis(t0), \u0108seis(t0) are defined in equations (11). In equations (8)-(13) (unlike in equation (4)), the angles \u03b8 are computed from the offsets in the original data, and the estimated velocity function in the overburden. Hence, there exists the possibility of error, from an incorrect velocity profile. In addition, the angles computed from offsets in the conventional manner are ray-angles, and must be converted to wavefront angles \u03b8, using the anisotropy profile in the overburden. Errors made in this computation translate directly into corresponding errors in the coefficients of equation (12). Embodiments compensate for such errors as shown below. In analogy with the analysis of the seismic data (13), a series of reflectivity spikes are selected (either by manual picking, or by sparse spike inversion) to represent major events in the synthetic data (equation (4)) which correlate with the selected events in equation (11). These spikes are termed syn(t0), syn(t0), syn(t0) and are found from the synthetic data equation (4)) as best-fits of the Aki-Richards form (12). Convolving these spikes with the zero-phase seismic wavelet: \u00c2 syn(t 0)\u2261w* syn(t 0) {circumflex over (B)} syn(t 0)\u2261w* syn(t 0) \u0108 syn(t 0)\u2261w* syn(t 0)\u2003\u2003(14) the reduced isotropic synthetic data is formed as: s ^ syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 , \u03b8 ) = \u03a3 t 0 \ue8a0 [ A ^ syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) + B ^ syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 + C ^ syn \ue8a0 ( t 0 ) \ue89e sin 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 \ue89e \ue89e tan 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b8 ] ( 15 ) The seismic gather of equation (13) has the same form as the isotropic synthetic gather of equation (14), with the exception of inclusion in the seismic gather of the (unknown) propagation operator P(t0,\u03b8), and including the presence of the anisotropy reflectivity terms in equation (9). Also included in P are the instrumental and computational operators (I and C), which impose large gain factors on the data. The seismic data (equation 13) usually have an absolute maximum value <104 (called \u0093seismic units\u0094, with unknown physical dimensions), whereas the synthetic data (equation 15) usually have an absolute maximum value <1 (nondimensional \u0093reflectivity units\u0094). Embodiments may augment the computational operator C with a multiplicative divisor, to make the amplitudes (of synthetic and seismic) comparable, in order to display them on the same plot. Accordingly, embodiments may multiply all the seismic amplitudes by the factor: N 0 \u2261 | syn | / | seis| \u2003\u2003(16) (c.f. equations (11) and (14) where the angle brackets represent an arithmetic average over the selected events in the logged interval, and the vertical bars represent absolute values). Normally, the adjusted-seismic and synthetic amplitudes will show significant differences from each other, since the seismic data contain the effects of both propagation and of anisotropy, whereas the synthetic data do not. In the present embodiment (discrete reflectivity impulses), the normalizing functions: N A(t 0)\u2261 syn(t 0)/N 0 seis(t 0) N B(t 0)\u2261 syn(t 0)/N 0 seis(t 0) N C(t 0)\u2261 syn(t 0)/N 0 seis(t 0)\u2003\u2003(17) are defined only at the selected values of t0. If the seismic data aeis(t0), aeis(t0), aeis(t0) were to be multiplied by these normalizing functions, the seismic data would be forced to match the isotropic synthetic data, as parameterized in equations (4 and 13). Instead, embodiments recognize that NA(t0), NB(t0), NC(t0) are time-series, each with a Fourier spectrum. Examining the propagation operator P(t0,\u03b8) in equation (7), it is observed that all of the propagation effects included therein accumulate progressively as the wave propagates, hence they contribute to the low-frequency parts of these spectra. By contrast, the reflectivity operator r(t0,\u03b8) in equations (7) and (8) fluctuates rapidly in time, contributing only to the high-frequency parts of these spectra. Hence, embodiments low-cut filter the data time-series, retaining only the high-frequency parts, which are due to the rapidly fluctuating reflectivity r(t0,\u03b8). One way to do this is to low-pass filter the normalization functions, obtaining NAlow(t0), NBlow(t0), NClow(t0), and multiply the seismic amplitudes seis(t0), seis(t0), seis(t0) by the low-pass normalization functions. The resulting amplitudes may be identical to the isotropic amplitudes syn(t0), syn(t0), syn(t0) except for the additive effects of anisotropic reflectivity (cf. equation (8)): N Alow(t 0)N 0 seis(t 0)\u2212 syn(t 0)=0\u2003\u2003(18a) N Blow(t 0)N 0 seis(t 0)\u2212 syn(t 0)=\u0394\u03b4/2\u2003\u2003(18b) N Clow(t 0)N 0 seis(t 0)\u2212 syn(t 0)=\u0394\u03b5/2\u2003\u2003(18c) If equation (18a) is not fulfilled by the data, this is not consistent with the present assumptions, and not interpretable in terms of anisotropy. There are two possible explanations: a) The computational operator C has not removed all multiples, and/or b) The reflectivity operator r(t0,\u03b8) is not a plane-wave/planar reflector operator, such as is given in equation (8). In the first case, embodiments may remove the multiples, e.g. by an f-k filtering operation, and the analysis repeated. The second case is more fundamental, as it requires a re-assessment of the reflection process. In the following, it is assumed that equation (18a) is respected by the data, with sufficient accuracy. To convert the computed jumps \u0394\u03b4, \u0394\u03b5 in equations (18b)-(18c) to absolute values \u03b4, \u03b5, embodiments identify, from the gamma-ray log, an interval of sandstone, and assign \u03b4, \u03b5=0 to that sandstone layer. Then embodiments directly find the parameters in the other layers, e.g.: \u03b42=\u03b41+\u0394\u03b4\u2003\u2003(19) The amplitudes aeis(t0) may be poorly determined, since it is common for this curvature parameter to be strongly affected by seismic noise. If the parameters \u03b5(t0) determined in accordance with embodiments are not reasonable (e.g. <0 or >0.2), this is the most likely cause. FIG. 1 shows results of application of an embodiment to an exemplary dataset. FIG. 1 shows the amplitudes syn(t0) (15), N0 seis(t0) (equations (12), (16)), and NBlowN0 seis(t0) (equation (18)), for the six major events in the logged interval. (The determination of the seismic parameter seis(t0) was not statistically reliable.) As expected, the anisotropic contributions (NBlowN0 seis\u2212 syn) are significant. FIG. 2 shows values for the anisotropy parameter \u03b4 produced by an embodiment for the exemplary data dataset, compared with the gamma-ray log, and plotted at the same scale. As shown; the correlation is good. FIG. 3 shows a flow diagram for a method 300 for determining anisotropy parameters of a formation in accordance with principles disclosed herein. Though depicted sequentially as a matter of convenience, at least some of the actions shown may be performed in a different order and/or performed in parallel. Additionally, some embodiments may perform only some of the actions shown. In some embodiments, at least some of the method 300, as well as other operations described herein, can be implemented as instructions stored in a computer readable medium and executed by one or more processors. A seismic data set is acquired using seismic data acquisition instruments known in the art. Similarly, a vertical well log is acquired using well logging instruments known in the art. An isotropic synthetic reflectivity gather is constructed using sonic VP0, VS0, and \u03c1 from the well log and a seismic wavelet from a CDP gather of the seismic data. In block 302, the intercept A, gradient B, and curvature C are determined for each major horizon of the seismic data, and of the synthetic data. Embodiments may determine intercept A, gradient B, and curvature C in accordance with the Aki-Richards equation. In block 304, a seismic normalization factor N0 is determined by dividing the average of the synthetic intercept A by the average of the seismic intercept A. In block 306, the normalization factor N0 is applied to the seismic data to scale the seismic data to the synthetic data. In block 308, the synthetic data is divided by the scaled seismic data to generated normalization factors NA, NB, and NC. In block 310, the normalization factors NA, NB, and NC are low pass filtered to eliminate propagation influence. In block 312, the seismic data is scaled using the low pass filtered normalization factors. In block 314, the difference of the scaled seismic data and synthetic data is determined to produce the anisotropy parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5 convolved with the seismic wavelet. In block 316, the anisotropy parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5 are determined for the layers of the formation. FIG. 4 shows a block diagram for a system 400 for determining anisotropy parameters of formations 418 in accordance with principles disclosed herein. The system 400 includes a processor 402 and storage 404. The system 400 may also include various other components that have been omitted from FIG. 4 in the interest of clarity. For example, embodiments of the system 400 may include a display device, user input devices, network adapters, etc. Some embodiments of the system 400 may be implemented as a computer, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, as server computer, a mainframe computer, or other suitable computing device. The processor 402 may include, for example, a general-purpose microprocessor, a digital signal processor, a microcontroller or other device capable of executing instructions retrieved from a computer-readable storage medium. Processor architectures generally include execution units (e.g., fixed point, floating point, integer, etc.), storage (e.g., registers, memory, etc.), instruction decoding, peripherals (e.g., interrupt controllers, timers, direct memory access controllers, etc.), input/output systems (e.g., serial ports, parallel ports, etc.) and various other components and sub-systems. The storage 404 is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium suitable for storing instructions executed by the processor 402 and data processed by the processor 404. The storage 404 may include volatile storage such as random access memory, non-volatile storage (e.g., a hard drive, an optical storage device (e.g., CD or DVD), FLASH storage, read-only-memory), or combinations thereof. The storage 404 includes anisotropy extraction module 406. The anisotropy extraction module 406 include instructions that when executed cause the processor 402 to perform the operations disclosed herein for extracting anisotropy parameters. Software instructions alone are incapable of performing a function. Therefore, in the present disclosure, any reference to a function performed by software instructions, or to software instructions performing a function is simply a shorthand means for stating that the function is performed via execution of the instructions by the processor 402. The storage 404 also includes seismic data 408 provided by the seismic data acquisition system 414, and well log 410 of well 420 provided by the well logging system 416 for processing by the anisotropy extraction module 406. Results of execution of the anisotropy extraction module 406 may be stored in the storage 404 as anisotropy parameters 412.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the field of imaging and, more particularly, to the imaging of nerve tissue and other diffusionally anisotropic structures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Although many techniques have been developed for locating and viewing the brain, spinal cord, and spinal roots within the spinal canal, hitherto there has not been a successful method for viewing the peripheral, autonomic, and cranial nerves. These nerves, collectively referred to herein as peripheral nerves, commonly travel through and along bone, muscle, lymphatics, tendons, ligaments, intermuscular septa, collections of fatty tissues, air and fluid spaces, veins, arteries, joints, skin, mucous membranes and other tissues. The relatively small size of peripheral nerves, as well as their close proximity to other tissue of comparable size and shape, makes them difficult to locate and identify. The examination of peripheral nerves is further complicated by the complexity of many such neural structures, such as the brachial plexus, lumbar plexus, and sacral plexus. These structures include bundles of nerves that may join together, separate, rejoin, intermix, and resegregate, forming intricate three dimensional patterns. A compression or irritation of a small area of nerve within such a plexus (e.g. in the shoulder) can cause pain, numbness, weakness or paralysis at some distant site (e.g. in one finger). Even when a surgeon attempts to expose the plexus for direct inspection, the anatomic complexity can prove overwhelming, rendering diagnosis inconclusive and surgery difficult and dangerous. Radiologic methods employing, for example, X-rays, have been developed to generate tissue specific images of various physiological structures including bone, blood vessels, lymphatics, the gastrointestinal tract, and the tissues of the central nervous system. Due in part to the neural characteristics noted above, however, these techniques have not been successfully used to generate suitable clinical images of peripheral nerves. Typically, the position of peripheral nerves in radiologic images has been inferred by reference to more conspicuous, non-neural structures such as tendons, vessels, or bone. For example, by producing an X-ray image of a region of the body through which a nerve of interest passes, non-neural structures can often be readily identified. Then, the locations of peripheral nerves in the region can be inferred from standard reference information about human anatomy. Due to the variability of nerve position from one individual to another, however, this technique is of limited value. One approach of particular interest that has been used to image physiological structures is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By way of introduction, MRI involves the exposure of tissue to a variety of different magnetic and radio-frequency (rf) electromagnetic fields. The response of the specimen's atomic nuclei to the fields is then processed to produce an image of the specimen. More particularly, the specimen is initially exposed to a polarizing magnetic field. In the presence of this field, nuclei exhibiting magnetic moments (hereinafter referred to as spins) will seek to align themselves with the field. The nuclei precess about the polarizing field at an angular frequency (hereinafter referred to as the Larmor frequency) whose magnitude depends upon both the field's strength and the magnetogyric constant of the specific nuclear species involved. Although the magnetic components of the spins cancel each other in a plane perpendicular to the polarizing field, the spins exhibit a net magnetic moment in the direction of the polarizing field. By applying an excitation field perpendicular to the polarizing field and at a frequency near the Larmor frequency, the net magnetic moment can be tilted. The tilted magnetic moment includes a transverse component, in the plane perpendicular to the polarizing field, rotating at the Larmor frequency. The extent to which the magnetic moment is tilted and, hence, the magnitude of the net transverse magnetic moment, depends upon the magnitude and duration of the excitation field. An external return coil is used to sense the field associated with the transverse magnetic moment, once the excitation field is removed. The return coil, thus, produces a sinusoidal output, whose frequency is the Larmor frequency and whose amplitude is proportional to that of the transverse magnetic moment. With the excitation field removed, the net magnetic moment gradually reorients itself with the polarizing field. As a result, the amplitude of the return coil output decays exponentially with time. Two factors influencing the rate of decay are known as the spin-lattice relaxation coefficient T1 and the spin-spin relaxation coefficient T2. The spin-spin relaxation coefficient T2 represents the influence that interactions between spins have on decay, while the spin-lattice relaxation coefficient T1 represents the influence that interactions between spins and fixed components have on decay. Thus, the rate at which the return coil output decays is dependent upon, and indicative of, the composition of the specimen. By employing an excitation field that has a narrow frequency band, only a relatively narrow band within a nuclear species will be excited. As a result, the transverse magnetic component and, hence, return coil output, will exhibit a relatively narrow frequency band indicative of that band of the nuclear species. On the other hand, if the excitation field has a broad frequency band, the return coil output may include components associated with the transverse magnetic components of a greater variety of frequencies. A Fourier analysis of the output allows the different frequencies, which can be indicative of different chemical or biological environments, to be distinguished. In the arrangement described above, the contribution of particular spins to the return coil output is not dependent upon their location within the specimen. As a result, while the frequency and decay of the output can be used to identify components of the specimen, the output does not indicate the location of components in the specimen. To produce such a spatial image of the specimen, gradients are established in the polarizing field. The direction of the polarizing field remains the same, but its strength varies along the x, y, and z axes oriented with respect to the specimen. By varying the strength of the polarizing field linearly along the x-axis, the Larmor frequency of a particular nuclear species will also vary linearly as a function of its position along the x-axis. Similarly, with magnetic field gradients established along the y-axis and z-axis, the Larmor frequency of a particular species will vary linearly as a function of its position along these axes. As noted above, by performing a Fourier analysis of the return coil's output, the frequency components of the output can be separated. With a narrow band excitation field applied to excite a select nuclear species, the position of a spin relative to the xyz coordinate system can then be determined by assessing the difference between the coil output frequency and the Larmor frequency for that species. Thus, the MRI system can be constructed to analyze frequency at a given point in time to determine the location of spins relative to the magnetic field gradients and to analyze the decay in frequency to determine the composition of the specimen at a particular point. The generation and sensing of the fields required for proper operation of an MRI system is achieved in response to the sequential operation of, for example, one or more main polarizing field coils, polarizing gradient field coils, rf excitation field coils, and return field coils. Commonly, the same coil arrangement is used to generate the excitation field and sense the return field. A variety of different sequences have been developed to tailor specific aspects of MRI system operation, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,322 (Glover); U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,501 (Conolly); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,020 (Ladebeck et al.). One application of conventional MRI systems is in the production of angiograms, or blood vessel images. Various different pulse sequences and processing techniques have been developed for use in MRI angiography, as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,582 (Redington); U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,985 (Macovski); U.S. Pat. No. 4,647,857 (Taber); U.S. Pat. No. 4,714,081 (Dumoulin et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,957 (Wehrli et al.); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,209 (Nishimura). As will be appreciated, blood vessels are readily differentiated from surrounding tissue by the pulsatile flow of blood therethrough. MRI angiography exploits this distinguishing characteristic to generate images of the blood vessels in various ways. For example, if the excitation field is pulsed at systole and diastole, the contribution of blood flow to the return field will differ, while the contribution of static tissue and bone to the return field will be the same. By subtracting one return from the other, the static component cancels, leaving only the contribution from the blood vessel. Unfortunately, because peripheral nerve does not exhibit the flow-distinctiveness of blood vessels, MRI angiography systems and pulse sequences can not be used to generate suitable images of peripheral nerve. Further, conventional MRI systems and sequences used for general imaging of tissue and bone do not provide acceptable results. Given the poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the return signals (e.g., on the order of 1\u00d7 to 1.5\u00d7) and the small size of the nerve, the conspicuity of imaged nerves relative to other tissue is collectively rendered so poor as to be diagnostically useless. One technique proposed for use in enhancing the utility of MRI systems in imaging neural tissue involves the use of pharmaceutical agents to enhance the contrast of neural tissue relative to surrounding tissue in the images produced. As described in PCT Patent Application No. PCT EP 91/01780 (Filler et al., WO 92/04916), published on Apr. 2, 1992, a two-part contrast agent, such as wheat germ agglutinin or dextrin-magnetite, is injected so that it is subsequently taken up, and transported, by the nerve of interest. The first part of the agent promotes neural uptake, while the second part of the agent has the desired \"imageable\" property. The agent is injected into muscle and undergoes axoplasmic flow in the nerve supplying that muscle, tagging the nerve in subsequently generated images of the specimen. If MRI is used, the second part of the agent is selected to have a magnetically active (e.g., ferrite) component. An agent having a high nuclear density can, however, be used to increase the contrast of the nerve upon X-ray or computed tomography (CT) examination, while a radioactive (e.g. positron emitting) element can be used to enhance visibility during positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. To illustrate the effectiveness of contrast agents in imaging nerve, reference is had to FIGS. 1-5. In that regard, FIG. 1 is a diagram of a transverse section of the upper forearm FA of a rabbit. The forearm includes the triceps muscle TM, ulnar nerve UN, brachial veins BV, median nerve MN, radial nerve RN, humerus H, cephalic vein CV, and biceps muscle BM. FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate spin-echo MR images of such a section, using a ferrite contrast agent, produced by a conventional MRI system at six-hour intervals. Although some of the larger structural elements are readily identified, the location of some objects appears skewed. More particularly, the humerus marrow appears shifted relative to the humerus H, as do ligaments L, and fat F between the biceps or triceps. In addition, smaller neural structures are difficult to distinguish. Several approaches are available, however, to attempt to identify nerves in the images generated. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, if a short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence of the type described in Atlas et al., STIR MR Imaging of the Orbit, 151 AM. J. ROENTGEN. 1025-1030 (1988) is used, the humerus marrow disappears from the image as does, more importantly, certain ambiguous, apparently non-neural structures adjacent the median nerve MN. Thus, as shown in the enlarged image of the region including the median nerve MN and ulnar nerve UN, provided in FIG. 4, the median nerve MN is visible. Similarly, even when the contrast agent images of FIGS. 2A and 2B are enlarged to better illustrate the region including the median nerve MN, as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, respectively, the nerves are distinguishable to a highly skilled observer. More particularly, transport of the ferrite contrast agent during the six-hour interval between the generation of images 4A and 4B results in a loss of intensity in the MN relative to the non-neural structure adjacent median nerve MN. Given this observation and the STIR-based assessment, the median nerve MN can, thus, be identified. The use of contrast agents, while promising, does have certain limitations. For example, there is an increasing preference to avoid the use of invasive technologies in medicine whenever possible. Further, contrast agents generally can be used to image only a single nerve or nerve group. Of perhaps greatest importance, the contrast agents employed typically reduce the intensity of the imaged nerve. Since nerves are already difficult to see in current MRI images, the impact of the contrast agent upon the image can be difficult to interpret, as illustrated by the discussion of FIGS. 2-5 above. In another application, MRI has been used, without contrast agents, to map non-peripheral, white matter nerve tracts in the brain. The white matter tracts extend through gray matter tissue in the brain and exhibit relatively high anisotropic diffusion. More particularly, given their physical structure (i.e., axonal pathways surrounded by myelin sheaths), water mobility along the white matter tracts is relatively high, while water mobility perpendicular to the tracts is low. The surrounding gray matter does not, however, exhibit this same anisotropy. A technique for MRI-based mapping of white matter nerve tracts that exploits this characteristic of neural tissue is described in Douek et al., Myelin Fiber Orientation Color Mapping, BOOK OF ABSTRACTS, SOCIETY OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE, p. 910 (1991). Basically, in addition to the fields and gradients described above, this process involves the use of a pair of field gradient pulses (hereinafter referred to as diffusion gradients), oriented perpendicular and parallel to the white matter tracts to be imaged. The effect of a pulsed gradient is to change the phase of the received signal from all of the spins. For stationary spins the effect of the two diffusion gradients cancels out. In contrast, spins moving from one spatial position to another in the time between the two diffusion gradients experience changes in the frequency and phase of the spin magnetization with the net effect being a reduction in the received signal. The signal reduction is greatest for those spins that diffuse the greatest distance between the two pulsed gradients. As noted above, given the anisotropic nature of the tracts, water will diffuse freely along a tract, but is restricted in it motion perpendicular to the tract. When the diffusion gradient is aligned with the tract there is thus a greater reduction in signal than when the diffusion gradient is aligned perpendicular to the tract. Because this phenomenon is not exhibited by the surrounding gray matter tissue, the white matter tracts can be identified. Anisotropic diffusion is also a recognized characteristic of peripheral nerve, as indicated in Moseley et al., Anisotropy in Diffusion-Weighted MRI, 19 MAGNETIC RESONANCE ON MEDICINE 321 (1991). The Douek et al. technology, however, does not distinguish peripheral nerve from muscle and other tissue for a number of previously unrecognized reasons. First, while the size and structure of the white matter tracts ensure that the resultant signals will be sufficiently strong for imaging, peripheral nerve is considerably smaller and more difficult to distinguish. Second, unlike the white matter tracts, peripheral nerve is commonly surrounded by muscle and fat, both of which impair the ability of the Douek et al. system to image nerve. By way of elaboration, given its fibrous structure, muscle also exhibits diffusional anisotropy, as recognized in Moseley et al., Acute Effects of Exercise on Echo-Planar T2 and Diffusion-Weighted MRI of Skeletal Muscle in Volunteers, BOOK OF ABSTRACTS, SOCIETY OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE 108 (1991). As a result, the simple anisotropic analysis of Douek et al. is unable to distinguish peripheral nerve and muscle. While fat is isotropic and, therefore, distinguishable from nerve, it also impairs the imaging of peripheral nerves. Specifically, the relative signal strength of fat returns to neural returns is so high as to render peripheral nerves unidentifiable in images produced. As will be appreciated from the preceding remarks, it would be desirable to develop a method for rapidly and non-invasively imaging a single peripheral nerve, or an entire neural network, without resort to contrast agents. The images generated should be sufficiently detailed and accurate to allow the location and condition of individual peripheral nerves to be assessed. It would further be desirable to provide a system that processes neural images to enhance the information content of the images, diagnose neural trauma and disorders, and inform and control the administration of treatments and therapy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to a new method, which quite remarkably, is capable of generating a three dimensional image of an individual patient's nerves and nerve plexuses. The image can be acquired non-invasively and rapidly by a magnetic resonance scanner. These images are acquired in such a way that some embodiments of the invention are able to make all other structures in the body including bone, fat, skin, muscle, blood, and connective tissues tend to disappear so that only the nerve tree remains to be seen. A plurality of the nerves passing through a given imaged region may be observed simultaneously, thus alleviating any ambiguity of nerve identification which might arise were only a single nerve imaged as with some contrast agent techniques. The invention is based on the discovery of a method of collecting a data set of signal intensities with spatial coordinates which describes the positions of the nerves within any two dimensional cross section of a living mammal or within any three dimensional data acquisition space. There exist a large number of pulse sequences capable of controlling or operating a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and each of which accomplishes some preferred image optimization. Previously, however, no simple (single) or complex (double or multiple) pulse sequence has been able to increase the relative signal intensity of nerve so that it is brighter than all other tissues in the body or limb cross section. Surprisingly, the inventors have discovered that there are certain novel ways of assembling complex pulse sequences, wherein even though the simple components of the sequence decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of nerve or decrease the signal strength of nerve relative to other tissues, the fully assembled complex sequence actually results in the nerve signal being more intense than any other tissue. In this fashion, the image conspicuity of nerve is greatly increased. Thus, a first aspect of the present invention provides a method of selectively imaging neural tissue of a subject without requiring use of intraneural contrast agents, the method comprising subjecting part of the subject anatomy to magnetic resonance imaging fields, detecting magnetic resonance and producing an image of neural tissue from said detected resonance so that a nerve, root, or neural tract of interest in said image can be visually differentiated from surrounding structures. A second aspect of the present invention provides a method of selectively imaging neural tissue of a subject, the method comprising subjecting part of the subject anatomy to magnetic resonance imaging fields adapted to discriminate anisotropy of water diffusion or other special characteristic of neural tissue, detecting magnetic resonance to produce an electronic signal in accordance with said resonance and producing an image of neural tissue from said electronic signal. The invention also provides an apparatus for selectively imaging neural tissue of a subject without requiring the use of neural contrast agents, the apparatus comprising means for subjecting part of the subject anatomy to magnetic resonance fields, means for detecting magnetic resonance to produce an electronic signal in accordance with said resonance, and means for producing an image of neural tissue from said electronic signal so that a nerve, root, or neural tract of interest in said image can be visually differentiated from surrounding structures. The invention also finds expression as an apparatus for imaging neural tissue of a subject, the apparatus comprising means for subjecting part of the subject anatomy to magnetic resonance fields adapted to discriminate anisotropy of water diffusion, means for detecting magnetic resonance to produce an electronic signal in accordance with said resonance and means for producing a selective image of neural tissue of interest from said electronic signal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to FIG. 6, a neurography system 10 is shown as one component of a broader medical system 12. Unlike prior art arrangements, system 10 quickly and non-invasively generates accurate images showing the pattern of individual peripheral nerves, or entire nerve trees, without the use of contrast agents. The system is designed to allow such images, hereinafter referred to as neurograms, to be displayed in two-dimensions, illustrating neural cross sections in the specimen under examination, or in three-dimensions. The images may selectively exclude all other structures within the specimen, or may illustrate the physical relationship of other structures relative to the nerves for reference. 1. Medical System Overview As shown in FIG. 6, the neurography system 10 included in medical system 12 includes four basic components: MRI system 14, processing system 16, input system 18, and output/display system 20. In the preferred arrangement, the MRI system 14 is a conventional MRI system modified for use in collecting image data of a patient P under examination. The processing system 16 responds to operator inputs applied via input system 18 to control MRI system 14 and process its output to display the resultant neurograms at system 20. As will be described in greater detail below, system 16 employs a variety of different imaging protocols, alone or in combination, to ensure that the images produced are of a quality heretofore unachieved. The medical system 12 includes a number of components that supplement the imaging information produced by system 10 and/or use that information for a variety of purposes. For example, an auxiliary data collection system 22 may be included to collect image information about non-neural structures, such as blood vessels and bone, in the imaged region of patient P. This information can then be used to suppress and/or enhance the appearance of those structures in the neurograms produced by system 10. A diagnostic system 24, included in system 12, may be used to analyze the images produced by system 10. Given the high resolution, detail, and accuracy of neurograms produced by system 10, system 24 can be programmed to analyze neural pathway information to detect discontinuities associated with, for example, neural compressions, injuries, and tumors. System 24 provides outputs indicative of the location of discontinuities and may, by consultation with a database of image information associated with clinically assessed abnormalities, provide an indication of the nature and magnitude of an imaged discontinuity. These outputs can be used for diagnosis, or applied as feedback to system 10 to refine a region of interest (ROI) under examination in patient P. Medical system 12 may also include a therapeutic system 26 and surgical system 28. Systems 26 and 28 employ information about the patient's neural structure from system 10 to assist in the proper administration of a desired therapeutic or surgical operation. For example, the information may be used to guide a robotic stylus to a damaged neural site for treatment or to allow an operation on non-neural structure to be performed without damage to the patient's peripheral nerves. The systems 26 and 28 may operate independent of physician control or may simply provide the physician with real-time feedback concerning the relationship between an operation being performed and the patient's neural structures. A training and development system 30 is included in the medical system 12 for a variety of different purposes. For example, the training system 30 may be used to demonstrate the anatomy of various neural structures, along with their positional relationship to non-neural patient structures. This information has great educational value given the extremely limited ability of prior an techniques, including direct examination, to provide detailed anatomical information. Training system 30 may also be designed to analyze the effectiveness of neurography system 10 and provide feedback used to control the pulse sequences and other operational parameters of system 10. As one final component, medical system 12 may include a host processing system 32 in addition to, or in place of, separate processing systems in the other components of system 12. Although not separately shown in FIG. 6, system 32 includes a central processing unit (CPU) coupled to the remainder of system 12 by input/output circuits. Memory is provided to store software instructions, used to control the operation of the CPU and, hence, the various components of system 12, and to store image and other data collected by system 12. The use of a separate host processing system 32 is particularly desirable where various components of system 12 are to be operated in interactive fashion pursuant to a single set of software instructions. 2. The Neurography System Turning now to a more detailed discussion of neurography system 10, by way of introduction, some of the more important operational features of system 10 are loosely depicted in the chart of FIG. 7. As will be described in greater detail below, system 10 may be constructed to employ one or more of these features to enhance the imaging ability of conventional MRI sufficiently to provide diagnostically and therapeutically useful information. As shown, the operation of system 10 can be broken down into the broad steps of data collection 34, image processing and analysis 36, image display 38, and control 40. The data collection process 34 involves, for example, spin-echo imaging 42, which may be supplemented by one or more of the following imaging protocols: fat suppression 44, diffusion weighting 46, and \"long T2\" processing 48, and other protocols including magnetization transfer. Each of these protocols has been found to enhance the quality of images of peripheral nerve sufficiently to provide heretofore unavailable MRI neurograms. The data collected by process 34 is subjected to image processing and analysis 36, involving two-dimensional and:three-dimensional image generation 50. Image generation 50 may be further enhanced by miscellaneous suppression features 52, responsible for reducing the influence of, for example, blood vessels and patient motion, on the images produced. An image subtraction feature 54 may also be employed to remove all non-neural components from the images. a. Neurography System Construction Having briefly summarized the operational aspects of neurography system 10, its construction and operation will now be considered in greater detail. In one embodiment, MRI system 14 includes an imager I of the type sold by GE Medical Systems, under the trademark SIGNA (software release 5.2). In that regard, as shown in FIG. 8, the region R of the patient to be imaged is placed within the bore B of the MRI system imager I. As will be described in greater detail below, the position of region R relative to the imager may be stabilized by a splint 58. Splint 58 limits motion artifact, provides fiducial markers in a secondary frame of reference, and reduces the system's susceptibility to boundary effects that otherwise might degrade fat suppression near the boundary between skin and air. MRI system 14 includes polarizing field coils 60 and 61 responsible for exposing region R to the desired polarizing field. The polarizing field has a strength of, for example, 1.5 Tesla and is oriented along a z-axis. A tuned rf excitation coil 62 is also positioned within bore B over the region R under investigation. Coil 62 is provided with a pulsed rf input, in a manner described below, to generate the field responsible for excitation of nuclear spins in region R. Coil 62 is also responsible for detecting the rf return, or echo, fields generated by the spins, although separate transmit and receive coils may alternatively be used. The excitation coil 62 may be, for example, a solenoid or surface coil, configured and dimensioned to fit closely over the region R to be imaged (e.g., the patient's arm, leg, shoulder, chest, pelvis, head, neck or back). In a preferred arrangement, however, a phased array coil system is employed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the returns, thereby providing an improvement in the spatial resolution of system 14 and allowing information to be retrieved from signals that would otherwise have been too weak to form useful images. For example, where peripheral nerve having a thickness on the order of 1-2 mm is to be sharply resolved, each array includes, for example, 4-6 individual coils, arranged in transverse and longitudinal pairs or linear paired arrays. Three pairs of gradient coils 64 and 66 are also positioned within the bore B of the imager. These coils superimpose a locational gradient of roughly one Gauss per centimeter upon the polarizing field over the sample region R along each of the x, y, and z-axes. For the sake of simplicity, however, only the z-gradient coils 64 and 66 are shown in FIG. 8. In the preferred arrangement, the same coil pairs 64 and 66 are used to produce diffusional gradients along the desired axes, as well as the requisite locational gradients. Alternatively, one or more separate diffusional gradient coil pairs 68 and 70 may be provided within the imager bore B. If the separate coil pair 68 and 70 is mounted on a movable track, substantially any desired diffusional gradient orientation can be achieved. The diffusional gradient is relatively strong compared to the locational gradients, e.g, ranging up to 10 Gauss/centimeter or higher. A computer 72 and front-end circuit 74 form the processing system 16, input system 18, and output/display system 20 of neurography system 10 shown in FIG. 6. Computer 72 and circuit 74 cooperatively control and synchronize the operation of MRI system 14, as well as process and display the acquired data. The computer 72 is, for example, an IBM-compatible personal computer including a 486 processor, VGA monitor, and keyboard. An interface bus 76, included in circuit 74, couples computer 72 to the other components of circuit 74. A gradient pulse generator 78 included in circuit 74 produces generally rectangular output pulses used to establish the desired gradients in the polarizing field. The output of generator 78 is applied to x-, y, and z-axis gradient field amplifiers 80, although only the z-axis amplifier 80 is shown in FIG. 8. As will be appreciated, if separate coils 68 and 70 are employed to establish the diffusional gradients, the output of generator 78 must be applied to those coils via separate amplifiers 82. Circuit 74 also includes an rf pulse generator 84, which produces rf signal pulses used in the establishment of the excitation field. In the preferred arrangement, the pulse generator produces an rf output suitable for use in proton MRI, although frequencies specific to other MRI susceptible nuclei, such as, 19 fluorine, 13 carbon, 31 phosphorus, deuterium, or 23 sodium, may be used. The output of generator 84 is amplified by a high-power rf amplifier 86 before being selectively applied to the excitation coil 62 by a duplexer 88. The duplexer 88 is also controlled to selectively steer the low level MR returns received by the excitation coil 62 to a preamplifier 90. A mixer 92 transforms the high frequency output of preamplifier 90 to a low frequency signal by mixing the amplified MR returns with signals from a digitally controlled rf oscillator 94, which also provides inputs to generator 84. The analog output of mixer 92 is input to a low pass filter 96 before finally being converted to a digital form by an analog-to-digital converter 98. The computer 72 processes the resultant digital inputs, which represent the response of the spins to the applied fields, to generate the desired neurograms. b. Neurography System Operation Having reviewed the basic construction of the neurography system 10, its operation to generate the desired two- or three-dimensional neurograms will now be considered. To that end, FIGS. 9 and 10 depict the general sequence of steps performed by system 10 in the production of neurograms. These neurograms exhibit a high nerve conspicuity, which for the purpose of the ensuing discussion will be understood to refer to the contrast (in, for example, intensity or color) between the nerve and the image background. The methods described below may be used to produce neurographic images of substantially any region of the body, including the brain, for example, central nervous system (CNS) neurograms. As indicated at block 100, the operation of the system is first initialized to establish certain parameters of the system's operation. In that regard, the operator may input desired parameters via computer 72 in response to queries generated at start up. Because most aspects of the system's operation are controlled by software resident in the memory of computer 72, default initialization parameters may also be accessed. Although the particular parameters to be initialized may vary at the user's discretion, examples include the type of images to be generated (i.e., two-dimensional cross sections or three-dimensional projections), field of view (FOV), thickness of each slice imaged, pulse repetition rate (TR), number of phase encoding steps, the existence of a known axis of diffusional anisotropy, and the strengths and orientations of the diffusional gradients to be used. By way of example, the operator may select a two-dimensional image, a FOV of four cm by four cm, a TR of 1.5 seconds, and 256 phase encoding steps. A discussion of anisotropic axis identification is provided below. Once initialization has been completed, a series of steps, corresponding to the data collection process 34 discussed in connection with FIG. 7, are performed. This process generally involves the control of pulse sequences used in connection with front end circuit 74. As will be described in greater detail below, different sets of pulse sequences and combinations of pulse sequences have been devised to unambiguously distinguish small peripheral nerves from neighboring structures of similar shape and location, including the combination of certain existing sequences into new groupings for use in new situations and the design of new sequences that incorporate optimized features for the purpose of neurographic imaging. For illustrative purposes, a graphic illustration of one example of a suitable pulse sequence is provided in FIGS. 11A through 11F. i. Fat Suppression As indicated in block 102 of FIG. 9, a first, optional, step performed in the image generation process is fat suppression. Although fat represents a known source of interference in MRI images of bone and tissue, it was not previously recognized as an impediment to effective neural imaging due to the broader perception that neural MR signals were inadequate for imaging regardless of background composition. The value of fat suppression was discovered during the development of the present invention by the fortuitous use of a main field magnet designed for spectroscopy as part of an imaging system. In that regard, in MR spectroscopy, a relatively strong magnetic field is employed to increase the separation in frequency between signals arising from different chemical species of the same nucleus, thereby allowing these components to be more easily distinguished. MRI also uses a frequency distribution (created by applying a field gradient) over a sample to locate spins and create an image. The signals from fat and water are at slightly different frequencies and therefore appear shifted relative to each other in an image. The fat/water shift is relatively small when a low field, clinical MRI system is used. Fortuitously, a much stronger spectroscopic field magnet was used during initial efforts at imaging nerve, introducing a much greater displacement of fat in the image produced. With the high intensity fat signal shifted away from the nerve, an enhancement of the nerve's conspicuity was observed. The recognition of this enhancement led to the realization that effective neural imaging could, in fact, be achieved through the inclusion of fat suppression in system 14. Fat suppression apparently enhances the use of conventional MRI systems for neurography in several ways. First, the removal of extraneous components reduces the number of imaged structures to be distinguished. Second, in a fat suppressed image a peripheral nerve exhibits a relatively high intensity and will stand out sharply against the low intensity space left behind by the suppressed fat. As will be described in greater detail below, fat suppression also synergistically increases the apparent magnitude of diffusion anisotropy and magnetization transfer effect. One suitable fat suppression technique involves the use of a chemical shift selective (CHESS) pulse sequence, described in detail, for example, in Haase et al. NMR Chemical Shift Selective Imaging, 30 PHYS. MED. BIOL. 341-344 (1985). As shown in FIG. 11A, CHESS involves the application of a sequence of narrow band rf pulses A, B and C to the excitation coil 62 to selectively excite the nuclear spins of fat molecules within the region R of the patient being imaged. By way of example, three millisecond Gaussian pulses having a minus three dB bandwidth of 600 Hertz may be employed. A sequence of gradient pulses a, b, and c is then applied to the three sets of gradient coils 64 and 66 to dephase the excited spins, thereby minimizing the contribution of the fat signals to the final image. The gradient pulses a, b, and c applied to the orthogonal gradient coil pairs produce, for example, gradients of five Gauss per centimeter for three milliseconds along the x, y, and z-axis, respectively. FIG. 12 illustrates the effect of fat suppression on neurograms produced with the MRI system 14. The image provided in FIG. 12 is of the forearm of a rabbit and corresponds to the images of FIGS. 1-5 described above. The darker portions of the image represent greater image intensity. As shown in FIG. 12, the ulnar nerve UN and median nerve MN are readily identified. As an alternative to the use of CHESS for fat suppression, the desired suppression may be effected by selective water stimulation. Other suitable alternatives include the Dixon technique for fat suppression described in, for example, Dixon et al., Simple Proton Spectroscopic Imaging, 153 RADIOLOGY 189-194 (1984) and also STIR (short tau inversion recovery) described in Improved Fat Suppression in STIR MR Imaging: Selecting Inversion Time through Spectral Display, 178 RADIOLOGY 885-887 (1991). Although in the preferred embodiment fat suppression is combined with other techniques such as diffusional weighting and long T2 processing, fat suppression by itself enhances conventional MRI processing sufficiently to generate clinically useful neurograms. Similarly, as will be described in greater detail below, other techniques employed by system 10 can be used without fat suppression to generate suitable neurograms. ii. Spin-Echo Sequence (Without Diffusional Weighting) Having discussed the optional introductory portion of the illustrative pulse sequence depicted in FIG. 11, the next phase of the neurography system's operation will now be considered. In that regard, an rf excitation pulse D, shown in FIG. 11A, is applied to coil 62 to tilt the net magnetic moment of the spins by ninety degrees relative to the polarizing field, into the transverse plane. The resultant maximum transverse magnetization then decays to zero as the spins dephase. A second pulse E, having twice the intensity of pulse D, is applied to coil 62 after a delay of one-half the return or echo time (TE). This pulse rotates the spins a further 180 degrees and causes a spin-echo to form as the spins rephase. The spin echo has a maximum amplitude after a further delay of TE/2. A spin-echo signal F is, thus, generated in coil 62 at time TE in response to the combined influence of excitation pulse D and refocusing pulse E. These steps are depicted in blocks 104, 106, and 108 of FIG. 9. At the same time, the imaging gradients are produced by the orthogonal coil pairs 64 and 66 to encode the echo signal F in the usual manner, allowing an MR image to be constructed, as indicated in block 110. With the sample oriented along the z-axis, the \"slice select\" pulses d, d', and e shown in FIG. 11C are applied to the z-axis coil pair 64 and 66, to excite and refocus the z-axis slice of interest. The \"readout gradient\" pulses f and f, shown in FIG. 11D, are applied to, for example, the x-axis coil pair 64-66 to achieve the desired output that is to be Fourier transformed. The \"phase encoding\" pulses g and g', shown in FIG. 11E, are applied to the y-axis coil pair 64 and 66, to control the number of echoes (e.g., 256) to be received. The sequence may be used to generate images from contiguous slices or regions of the patient. As will be appreciated, if the operator indicates (at block 100) that diffusional weighting is not required for the generation of a particular image by neurography system 10, the pulses shown in FIGS. 11A-11E define substantially the entire spin-echo sequence. Even if diffusional weighting is to be employed, in the preferred embodiment an initial image is generated using only fat suppression for enhancement and, as a result, diffusional weighting is not used during the first performance of the spin-echo sequence (blocks 104-110) for a particular slice. Although spin-echo imaging is employed in the preceding embodiment of neurography system 10, other techniques can be employed. Suitable alternative techniques include, for example, stimulated echo imaging and gradient-recalled echo imaging, e.g., echo planar imaging (EPI). Such alternative techniques are described in Parikh, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TECHNIQUES (1992). iii. Echo Processing In the imaging sequence depicted in FIG. 11, a series of echo signals F are acquired to create a two-dimensional image. For example, at block 112 in FIG. 9, 256 echoes with 256 different phase encoding gradient amplitudes are used to construct a 256-by-256 pixel image. The data set is then enlarged at block 114 by zero filling to produce a 1024-by-1024 matrix of data. As a result, the apparent resolution of the final image is increased, making the image clearer. Next, the enlarged data set is processed using a 2D Gaussian filter at block 116. The filter smoothes the image by attenuating the high frequency components in the image and, thus, clarifies the delineation of small details without altering the relative average pixel intensities over a region of interest. At block 118, the two-dimensional matrix of data then undergoes a two-dimensional Fourier transform, which yields an image to be stored. If desired, the image may also be displayed on the computer monitor, although in the preferred arrangement this image is but one component used in a more extensive analysis performed to generate a select, enhanced image. Once an initial image has been generated, the analysis of the image is initiated, as shown in FIG. 10. At block 122, one or more regions of interest (ROI) within the image can be identified. Each ROI may be a single pixel or voxel, or a larger region. ROI selection can be performed manually using, for example, a keyboard or mouse to move a cursor over the ROI on the displayed image. Alternatively, ROI selection may be accomplished automatically via a sequential selection of all pixels or via an external input regarding a particular region from, for example, diagnostic system 24. Next, the average image or pixel intensity within each ROI is computed at block 124. This average image intensity S can be represented by the following expression: S=A0 [exp (-TE/T2)][exp (-bD)] (1) where A0 is the absolute signal intensity for a particular pixel and b is the gradient factor, determined in accordance with the expression: b=\u03b32 (Gi 2)(\u03b42)(\u0394-\u03b4/3)(2) where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, Gi is the polarizing field strength, \u03b4 is the length of a diffusional weighting gradient pulse, and \u0394 is the interval between diffusional weighting gradient pulses. As will be appreciated, in the first iteration before diffusional weighting is employed, the final term of equation (1) is, thus, unity. To make use of the expressions in equations (1) and (2), the preceding data acquisition process is repeated for different values of echo time TE. On the other hand, if diffusional weighting is employed, as described in greater detail below, the data acquisition process is repeated for different gradient strengths (controlled by adjusting gradient magnitude and/or duration) or gradient orientations. For example, TEs of 30, 60, 90, and 110 milliseconds, or gradient magnitudes of 0, 3, 5, and 7 Gauss/centimeter, may be employed. The image intensity S for a particular pixel of these multiple images of the same transverse slice for particular values of TE (or b, if diffusional weighting is employed) is available and a linear regression analysis of the logarithmic relationship is performed at block 126. Finally, the value of the apparent T2 relaxation time (or the apparent diffusion coefficient D, if diffusional weighting is employed) is computed for a particular ROI at block 128. These computations provide quantitative assessments of the various ROI in the image that are useful in subsequent image processing by other components of the medical system 12. iv. Gradient Orientation for Diffusion Weighting In the preferred arrangement, after the initial fat suppressed image has been collected and its ROI characterized, a diffusional weighting analysis is initiated to further enhance the neurograms generated by evaluating the diffusional anisotropy exhibited by nerve and other tissue. The first aspect of this analysis is the selection of the diffusional gradients to be used. By way of introduction, in one currently preferred embodiment, the analysis involves the application of pulsed magnetic field gradients to the polarizing field in two or more directions to produce images in which the peripheral nerve is enhanced or suppressed, depending upon the \"diffusion weighting\" resulting from the particular pulsed gradient axis chosen. Discrimination of water diffusion anisotropy is then achieved by subtracting the suppressed image from the enhanced image, in the manner described in greater detail below, producing an image depicting only the peripheral nerve. Most preferably, the magnetic field gradients are applied in mutually substantially orthogonal directions. For example, with gradients approximately perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the peripheral nerve at the particular point being imaged, the parallel gradient image can be subtracted from the perpendicular gradient image to produce the desired \"nerve only\" image. As will be appreciated, if the axis of the nerve is generally known to the operator and its relationship to the referential frame of the MRI system 14 has been indicated at initialization block 100, the direction of the desired orthogonal diffusional weighting gradients can be readily determined. On the other hand, if the axis of the peripheral nerve is not known, or if many;nerves having different axes are being imaged, the neurography system 10 must employ a system of gradient orientations suitable for imaging nerve having substantially any axial alignment. For example, as will be described in greater detail below, a full three-dimensional vector analysis can be used to characterize the diffusion coefficient and provide a nerve image by construction based upon a fixed arrangement of diffusion weighting gradients. In anatomical regions, such as the upper arm or wrist, it is also possible to achieve adequate enhanced isolation of the nerve image by applying only a single diffusion gradient perpendicular to the axis of the nerve at the site of interest. As a result, no subtraction need be carried out to produce the neurogram. The fat suppressed, orthogonally diffusion weighted image can either be processed directly, or it can be subject to threshold processing to remove signals of lower intensity associated with non-neural tissue, or nerves with different axes and directions of travel at the imaging location. As will be appreciated, for quicker and more efficient data collection and processing, the establishment of diffusion gradients in the polarizing field should be responsive to the particular one of the foregoing scenarios that applies to the imaging problem at hand. Depending upon the inputs provided at block 100, the system may have been advised that (a) only one gradient of known orientation is required, (b) two orthogonal gradients of known orientation are required, or (c) two or more gradients of unknown orientation are required. As indicated in block 130 of FIG. 10, upon completion of the analysis of an image, the system considers whether all of the desired diffusional gradients have been applied to the polarizing field during subsequent data acquisition by, for example, spin-echo processing, or fast spin-echo processing. Because no diffusional gradient was used in the initial fat suppression processing, the answer is initially NO and operation proceeds to block 132. There, the computer determines whether the operator initially indicated that the axis of diffusional anisotropy is known. If the axis is known, a perpendicular diffusional gradient is employed, as indicated at block 134. Then, as indicated at block 136, a diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence is performed (modified by the inclusion of the diffusional gradient in the manner described in greater detail below) and image generated, pursuant to blocks 102-122, before quantification of the image data occurs at blocks 124-128 to compute D or T2. If the operator indicated at initialization that orthogonal diffusion gradients are required for the particular imaging problem at hand, this process is then repeated at blocks 138 and 140 for a parallel diffusional gradient. If the inquiry performed at block 132 determines that the axis of diffusional anisotropy is unknown, operation proceeds to block 142. There an initial diffusional gradient is arbitrarily selected, to be followed by a sequence of alternative gradients selected for use by the operator when the anisotropic axis is unknown. At block 144, using the initial diffusional gradient, a spin-echo sequence is performed (modified by the inclusion of the diffusional gradient in the manner described in greater detail below) and image generated, pursuant to blocks 102-122, before quantification of the imaged data occurs at blocks 124-128. Then, at block 146, a test is performed to determine whether the desired number of different diffusional gradients (e.g., three gradients, along the x-, y-, and z-axes) have been used. If not, the next diffusional gradient is selected at block 148 and the spin-echo sequence, imaging and processing operations are performed, as indicated at block 144. This process is then repeated until the desired number of alternative diffusional gradients have been employed. As will be appreciated, additional gradient coils may be provided where gradients are desired along axes other than those provided by the locational gradient coils. To that end, diffusional gradient coils may be mounted on a magnetically compatible, adjustable track within the bore of the imager to allow gradients to be repositioned and applied over a substantially continuous range of orientations. Similarly, the region to be imaged may be movably supported relative to a fixed set of gradient coils to introduce the desired variability in gradient direction. As another option, a plurality of different gradient coils may be employed and activated in various combinations to effect the desired gradient variations. Alternatively, the results obtained from a limited number of gradient directions can be processed using a vector analysis to estimate the results obtainable with a gradients other than those directly available, as described in greater detail below. v. Spin-Echo Sequence For Diffusional Weighting As noted briefly above, for each of the different diffusional gradients employed, the spin-echo sequence is repeated, followed by the generation of image data and the processing of that data to, for example, quantify the relaxation time T2 or diffusion coefficient D. In the preferred arrangement, the use of diffusion gradients influences a number of aspects of the spin-echo sequence. As shown in FIG. 11F, two pulses h and h', applied to the desired pair of gradient coils are used to establish a particular diffusional gradient in the polarizing field. For an echo time (TE) of 50 milliseconds, the duration (\u03b4) of each pulse is, for example, 10 milliseconds and their separation (\u0394) is 20 milliseconds. In the presence of the diffusional gradient, the echo signal F, and therefore the pixel or voxel intensity in the image ultimately produced, is made sensitive to the spatial diffusion of water molecules in the imaged region R. In that regard, as indicated above, with the diffusional gradient oriented substantially perpendicular to the diffusionally anisotropic nerve, the nerve image is enhanced and generally exhibits the highest intensity of various features imaged. This phenomena is depicted in FIG. 13A, which is an image of the forearm of a rabbit, corresponding to the diagram provided in FIG. 1. The ulnar nerve UN and median nerve MN are both relatively dark (high intensity) and are easily seen. Alternatively, with the diffusional gradient oriented substantially parallel to the diffusionally anisotropic nerve, the nerve image is suppressed and generally exhibits a lower intensity than other features imaged, as illustrated in FIG. 13B. These images can be combined, via a subtraction process described in greater detail below, to produce an image of the nerve isolated from all other structure. To reduce the effect of cross-terms between the imaging gradients and the diffusion weighting gradients, the spin-echo sequence illustrated in FIG. 11 is a modified version of conventional sequences. More particularly, the readout gradient rephasing pulse f shown in FIG. 11D, is placed directly before the acquisition of echo F in FIG. 11A, instead of after the slice-selective excitation pulse d, shown in FIG. 11C. However, a consequence of this change was the appearance of artifacts in the non-diffusion-weighted images due to an unwanted echo, presumably formed from imperfections in the slice-selection pulses d, d', and e, shown in FIG. 11C. To overcome this problem, a second modification of the pulse sequence was made. Specifically, the phase-encoding gradient was split into two sections g and g', and two or four transients (depending upon S/N) were acquired with phase cycling. As a result, the remaining cross terms contribute less than three percent to the diffusion weighting factor. Although fat suppression is not required to take advantage of the image enhancements available through diffusional weighting gradients, in the preferred arrangement, the fat suppression sequence shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B is employed prior to the initiation of the diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence. As will be described in greater detail below, the combination of these techniques generally provides an image quality that exceeds that available from either technique individually. The echo F produced using the diffusion weighted pulse echo sequence is processed in the manner described above in connection with blocks 112 through 128 of FIGS. 9 and 10. With diffusion weighting, the computation of the diffusional coefficient D at block 128 is preferably based upon the analysis of data collected for different gradient magnitudes. For example, the computation may be based upon gradients of 0, 3, 5, and 7 Gauss/centimeter, resulting in the production of image data as represented in FIGS. 14A through 14D, respectively. While fat, bone, marrow, skin and vessels are generally absent even at the lower gradients, muscle and ligaments drop out at the higher gradients. As suggested previously, the increasingly stronger gradients may be achieved by increasing gradient duration, rather than magnitude. Alternatively, the iterative data collection process may be performed using different gradient directions. vi. Image Selection/Production Once computer 72 determines, at block 130, that images have been collected for all of the desired diffusional gradients, operation proceeds to block 150. If the axis of anisotropy is unknown, the various diffusional coefficients D computed for each ROI using different gradient orientations are compared at block 150 to identify the maximum and minimum values. These coefficients provide a measure, associated with each pixel or voxel, of the magnitude of diffusional anisotropy at that point, while the anisotropic direction is indicated by the gradient orientation. (a) Subtraction Neurography In the preferred arrangement, the images associated with the maximum and minimum values of the diffusional coefficients for a particular ROI are then used in a subtraction process, as indicated at block 152. The image associated with the larger coefficient is produced by a gradient that is more nearly perpendicular to the neural axis, enhancing the nerve image, while the image associated with the smaller coefficient is produced by a gradient that is more nearly parallel to the axis, selectively destroying the nerve signal. When these two penultimate images are then mathematically (or photographically or optically) subtracted from one another, a subtraction neurogram is produced. By way of illustration, FIG. 15A is an image produced without diffusion weighting. FIGS. 15B and 15C then illustrate images produced using parallel and perpendicular gradients, respectively. Finally, the subtraction neurogram produced when the image of FIG. 15C is subtracted from that of FIG. 15B is shown in FIG. 15D. This \"ideal\" neurogram is somewhat analogous to a subtraction angiogram (an image showing only blood vessels), but sharply highlights a nerve rather than a vessel. Such an image is particularly useful for confirming the identification of nerves in a given imaging plane or space as well as for locating nerve injuries and nerve compressions. Despite the well known existence of angiograms showing the entire vascular pattern in an anatomic region, and despite the existence of MRI techniques that could have been applied to the problem of neural imaging techniques, and despite the great need for the visualization of nerves, particularly, in isolation, there has not previously been any way of creating such neurograms. Although image subtraction is employed in the preferred arrangement, it is not necessary. For example, in some applications of known anisotropy, subtraction is unnecessary and can be foregone in favor of a threshold analysis. Also, the subtraction process can be further supplemented, if desired. For example, the output of the subtraction process can be divided by the signal information from a fat suppressed, T2 -weighted spin echo sequence (e.g. using the aforementioned CHESS technique). One potential problem to be addressed by the use of the subtraction process is image registration. As will be appreciated, provided that non-neural tissue is identically located in both images subjected to the subtraction process, the non-neural component will cancel out of the resultant image. On the other hand, if some shift or other discrepancy in the apparent position of non-neural tissue is introduced into an image due, for example, to movement of the subject, cancellation may not occur and the nerve may actually be more difficult to identify in the resultant image. In one embodiment, acceptable image registration is evaluated prior to initiation of the subtraction process. More particularly, the intensities of pixels in one image are compared to the intensities of corresponding pixels in the second image. Pixels of neural tissue are disqualified on the basis of their high diffusional anisotropy, assessed via their diffusion coefficients. Unless the intensities of the remaining, non-neural pixels fall within a certain range of each other, indicating acceptable image registration, subtraction will be inhibited. (b) Vector Processing and Three-Dimensional Image Generation Up to this point, the output produced is generally in the form of a single two-dimensional image, or a series of two-dimensional images that can be related to form a three-dimensional image. In a simple form of three-dimensional image generation, described in greater detail below, the high S/N ratio of the two-dimensional neurograms produced by system 14 readily allows the imaged nerve cross-sections to be identified and then linked together to form a three-dimensional projection of the neural structure. As will be appreciated, however, depending upon the neural pattern involved and the spatial resolution required, this simplified approach may introduce undesired discontinuities into the three-dimensional projection. A more sophisticated processing scheme employs information about the anisotropic direction of the nerve in each two-dimensional image to further enhance the accuracy of three-dimensional image projections. The availability of information regarding anisotropic direction is also useful in establishing the optimal directions for the gradients used in the diffusional weighting analysis described above to produce a two-dimensional image. In that regard, the anisotropic axis of the peripheral nerve being imaged is sometimes known to the operator, allowing the operator to input the directional information at block 100 and select the best diffusional gradients for imaging. More commonly, however, nerves and CNS neural tracts follow relatively complex paths and the direction in which the diffusion anisotropy coefficient of the nerve or tract is greatest gradually shifts from one plane or axis to another as the nerve or tract curves or turns. As a result, one or two arbitrarily oriented, standard gradients may be inadequate to provide the desired images. Changes in neural direction can be monitored by moving the patient relative to a fixed set of gradient coils or employing movable diffusional gradient coils mounted, on a track with a non-magnetic drive system, within the bore of the imager to adjustably control the orientation of the diffusional gradients applied to the region of interest. By monitoring changes in the ratio of Dpl /Dpr obtained for a given pixel using alternative gradient alignments, or for sequential pixels using the same gradient alignments, changes in neural direction can be estimated and suitable gradient directions selected. Alternatively, gradient coils oriented in three planes can be simultaneously activated in various combinations to achieve the effect of an infinite variety of differently oriented gradients. One advantage of attempting to track changes in neural direction is that parallel and perpendicular gradient information can then be collected and used to produce a subtraction neurogram of the type described above. If, however, the optimal gradient directions for a given pixel are determined using feedback from images generated with repetitively adjusted gradients, processing speed may be significantly impaired. In many cases the well known anatomy of a nerve will permit the use of a particular axis orientation in advance. Initial imaging information will provide a description of the gross course of the nerve. A subsequent \"informed\" approximation can optimize the orientation in each slice. This can be useful to insure excellent homogeneity of nerve image intensity or to measure the coefficient of anisotropy along the course of the nerve. As a preferred alternative, requiring less mechanical complexity and faster processing speed, a technique has been developed for observing diffusional anisotropy, independent of its degree of alignment with any individual gradient axes. This process involves the combination of information from anisotropy measurements obtained along three standard orthogonal axes or using information from multiple fixed axes. For example, in the preferred embodiment, a vector analysis is used to produce interpolated images and directional information from the three orthogonal diffusion-weighted images described above. In that regard, image information is collected from, for example, four \"multi-slice\" sets using a zero diffusion gradient B0 and diffusion gradients Bx, By, Bz in the x-, y-, and z-orthogonal directions, respectively. For each pixel in the image to be produced, information concerning the corresponding pixels in the four diffusion gradients images is combined to produce a diffusion vector, representative of water molecule movement along the nerve fiber in either direction. This vector has a magnitude representative of the image intensity of the pixel and a direction representative of an \"effective\" diffusion gradient associated with the pixel. More particularly, the image intensity Sn of a given pixel in the new image is calculated using the following vector equation: Sn =vector length=[(Sx 2 +Sy 2 +Sz 2)So 2 ]1/2 (3) where Sx, Sy, and Sz are the image intensities of the corresponding pixels in the images produced by the Bx, By, and Bz gradients. S0 is the image intensity of the corresponding pixel in the image produced by the B0 gradient and is included in equation (3) to normalize the resultant image intensity Sn. The direction of the effective gradient associated with this pixel image includes components \u03b8xy, \u03b8xz, and \u03b8yz, computed in the following manner: \u03b8xy =diffusion vector angle between Bx and By =arc tan (Sy /Sx) (4) \u03b8xz =diffusion vector angle between Bx and Bz =arc tan (Sx /Sz) (5) \u03b8yz =diffusion vector angle between By and Bz =arc tan (Sy /Sz) (6) The parameters computed in equations (3), (4), (5), and (6) can be used to generate images in a variety of different ways. For example, the intensities of the pixels can be displayed as a \"vector length\" image. An illustration of a vector length CNS image, in which the intensity of the image is proportional to the magnitude of Sn is shown in FIG. 16. The image of FIG. 16 is a brain scan of a monkey (macaca fascicularis) weighing 2-2.5 kg, performed using diffusion imaging (spin-echo) on a General Electric CSI II imager/spectrometer (2 Tesla, equipped with actively shielded gradients). The acquisition parameters were: TR=1000 ms, TE=80 ms, diffusion gradients=5 Gauss/cm, diffusion gradient duration=20 ms, diffusion gradient separation=40 ms. Four slices of thickness 4 mm were imaged. T2 -weighted images were used to reproducibly select the diffusion images. As an alternative to the use of vector length images, arctan images can be employed. These images are obtained by establishing the intensity of a pixel in direct proportion to the angular output of one of equations (4), (5), or (6). An illustration of an arctan image is provided in FIG. 17. As shown in this example of a CNS neurogram, a select neural tract of interest can be effectively traced and made to stand out in isolation from other neural tracts. When used to evaluate lesions in CNS images of the type shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, vector length images will be more sensitive to water diffusion changes where all three orthogonal images change in the same way, while the vector angle images will be sensitive to changes in anisotropy between two orthogonal directions. A CNS lesion caused by experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced by myelin basic protein is demonstrated by its departure from the diffusional anisotropy, which appears as vector length decreases and image intensity changes accentuated in particular vector angle images. Alternative forms of vector analysis can also be applied, for example, as described in Basser et al., Fiber Orientation Mapping in an Anisotropic Medium with NMR Diffusion Spectroscopy, SMRM BOOK OF ABSTRACTS 1221 (1992). Similarly, tensor analyses employing tensors of various ranks, as described in Basser et al., Diagonal and Off Diagonal Components of the Self-Diffusion Tensor: Their Relation to an Estimation from the NMR Spin-Echo Signal, SMRM BOOK OF ABSTRACTS 1222 (1992), can be used to treat, or transform the coordinates of, MR diffusional anisotropy data. Suitable alternative processing techniques have been developed for use in the evaluation of magnetic, thermal, and structural anisotropy data. Unlike prior art systems, because the non-neural components of the neurograms produced by system 14 exhibit a relatively low intensity, or indeed disappear entirely from the images, the computer 72 is readily able to identify nerve locations in the anatomical structure and to correctly trace the course of the nerves between two-dimensional image planes or through a three-dimensional acquisition volume. For example, the location of nerves in a given image plane can be detected by comparing pixel intensity to some threshold level. A three-dimensional image can then be formed by linking or projecting the results of these two-dimensional analyses over the desired volume. As an alternative, the vector information obtained above can be used to track continuous serial changes in the direction of maximum anisotropy of a nerve or neural tract as the nerve or tract travels along its natural course. In that regard, the direction of maximum anisotropy for each voxel associated with a nerve is determined and a voxel connection routine, of the type described in Saloner et al., Application of a Connected-Voxel Algorithm to MR Anglographic Data, 1 JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING 423-430 (1991), is then used to link up voxels of maximum anisotropy. The resultant plot of the nerve or neural tract provides enhanced spatial resolution and less discontinuity from one image plane to the next. As an alternative to the two-dimensional imaging sequences described above, it is also possible to carry out the signal acquisition using a \"three dimensional\" imaging sequence of the type described in Frahm et al., Rapid Three-Dimensional MR Imaging Using the FLASH Technique, 10 JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED TOMOGRAPHY 363-368 (1986). The output of this sequence is then processed using a three-dimensional Fourier transform to extract the returns from nuclei over the volume being imaged. The resultant processing used to compute D for a given voxel and to generate, for example, a subtraction angiogram is substantially the same as described above. Regardless of the routine employed to project the neural structure in three-dimensions, the system 10 may be further programmed to implement the projection by referring to known characteristics of the structure. More particularly, once a given nerve has been identified in a given two-dimensional image, an \"expert\" system 10 is able to predict the occurrence of certain branches and mergers in this structure, albeit at unknown locations. This information can then be used to test the plausibility of the projection being generated, refining it where necessary. vii. Results of Combined Fat Suppression and Diffusion Weighting As previously noted, both muscle and nerve exhibit diffusional anisotropy. In view of the relatively low signal strength of neural components, diffusional analyses were not expected to provide clinically useful neurograms. The combined use of fat suppression and diffusional weighting has, however, been found to be extremely effective in providing the desired nerve image enhancement. By way of illustration, for a gradient strength of 7 G/cm and an echo time of 50 ms, an nerve image signal intensity (Sn) of 17 and a muscle image signal intensity (Sm) of 7 were calculated, based upon the difference between signal intensities with pulsed gradients oriented perpendicular and parallel to the nerve. A nerve-to-muscle contrast parameter R of 2.43 was then computed as the ratio Sn /Sm. Similarly, a comparison of the apparent diffusion coefficients for diffusional gradients perpendicular (Dpr) and parallel (Dpl) to nerve and muscle are as follows: ______________________________________Apparent Diffusion Coefficients (10-5 cm2 /sec) Muscle Nerve______________________________________Dpr 1.17 0.65Dpl 2.18 2.00Dpl /Dpr 1.9 3.1______________________________________ These results clearly illustrate that the neural components exhibit a far larger relative change in intensity than muscle components when subjected to diffusion anisotropy analysis. An unexpected and apparently synergistic benefit of fat suppression, when used in combination with diffusional weighting, is that an actual increase in neural signal anisotropy is experienced, with the conspicuity of the neural component of the image increasing by roughly 250 percent when the fat component is removed. The combined increase in nerve conspicuity and reduction in fat interference significantly enhances the effectiveness of neural imaging. Although not entirely understood, there are several potential explanations for the synergistic relationship between fat suppression and diffusional weighting. First, it appears that fat suppression may increase the apparent diffusional anisotropy of nerve, enhancing the utility of diffusional weighting gradients in the detection of neural tissue. By way of illustration, an indicated in the following test data, obtained with the signal from fat and \"short T2 \" water removed, the intensity of the remaining image signal was due largely to anisotropically diffusing water. ______________________________________ CHESS Applied CHESS Not Applied Gradient Direction Gradient DirectionNerve Imaged pr pl Ratio pr pl Ratio______________________________________Ulnar Nerve 29 <8 >3.6 62 49 1.3Median Nerve 30 <8 >3.8 46 22 2.1Muscle 14 8 1.8 18 12 1.5______________________________________ The synergistic role of fat suppression can also be viewed as a demonstration of a magnetization transfer effect. More particularly, the irradiation of protons on e.g,. myelin lipids surrounding the nerve by the saturation pulse of the fat suppression sequence may allow transfer of the saturation pulse to water molecules in close association with the lipid, allowing for very efficient transfer. Subsequently, these molecules can exchange into the anisotropically diffusing mobile water pool. vii. Long TE/TR/T2 Processing As an alternative to the use of diffusional gradients described above, in some regions of interest, it is possible to achieve adequate enhanced isolation of the nerve image by use of a spin echo fat suppression technique with a relatively long TE (echo time) or TR (repetition time) to achieve a T2 -weighted image. In that regard, after fat suppression, the dominant component remaining in the echo F is returned from muscle. Because the T2 of peripheral nerve has been measured by the inventors to be roughly twice as long as the T2 of muscles, the use of a relatively long TE or TR in the spin echo sequence allows the muscular return to be removed. The basic operation of a neurography system 14 employing this feature remains the same as that shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 except that the initialized value for TE is extended. In that regard, the operator may be called upon to initially consider whether the desired imaging is likely (e.g., neural imaging in a patient's limbs) or unlikely (e.g., CNS imaging) to be disrupted by the presence of muscle. If muscular interference is likely, a relatively long TE of between 50 and 100 milliseconds or even longer is initialized at block 100. The particular TE or TR selected depends upon the degree of T2 weighting desired. Alternatively, the system 14 may be programmed to compare the imaging data separately collected using long TE processing and diffusional weighting to assess which provides the best results. Illustrations of the results available with long TE imaging are provided in FIGS. 18A through 18D, for TE equal to 30, 40, 60, and 100 milliseconds, respectively. In the image of the forearm of a rabbit, provided in FIG. 18D, produced with a field strength of 4.7 Tesla, nerves are brighter than any other structure in the image. The extent of the increased nerve conspicuity is on the order of ten-fold, rendering the images clearly susceptible for use in constructing neurograms. As will be appreciated, lesser conspicuities on the order of 1.1 may also be useful. The use of extended TE processing had previously been considered unfeasible. In that regard, as described in Moseley et al., Anisotropy in Diffusion-Weighted MRI, 19 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE 321, 325 (1991), nerve was believed to exhibit a relatively short T2 time. Surprisingly, however, measurements have been conducted indicating that the T2 of muscle is approximately 27 milliseconds, while the T2 of peripheral nerve is approximately 55 milliseconds, providing a factor of two difference between the two types of tissue. ix. Additional Enhancements for Neural Imaging (a) Vessel Suppression In addition to the fat suppression and muscle suppression techniques described above, vessel suppression may be employed to improve the neurographic selectivity of the images generated by system 14. Due to the brightness of slowly moving blood in some otherwise useful sequences, vessel suppression has particular value when used in connection with long TE sequence neurograms. A variety of alternative approaches can be employed to achieve the desired blood vessel suppression. For example, in a first embodiment, the blood vessels are separately imaged to produce a flow-based MR angiogram, employing phase contrast or time-of-flight information. The angiogram may be produced using the MRI system 14, under separate program instructions, or the auxiliary data collection system 22 described below. The angiogram is then subtracted from the neural image to provide a neurogram in which blood vessels content is completely suppressed. As previously noted in connection with the discussion of image subtraction, a registration problem occurs when the information to be removed from one image is not identically represented with the same intensity and location in the subtrahend image. With vessel image information obtained using an angiography pulse-echo sequence (or other techniques described below) and neural image information obtained using the neural pulse-echo sequence described above, some difference in vessel intensity in the two images is to be expected. One way of avoiding registration error in this situation is to normalize the angiogram to the corresponding neural image (i.e., equalize angiogram intensity based upon comparative measurements at a vessel pixel identified on the angiogram). A second technique used for vessel suppression is to employ a short TE sequence to produce a first image in which blood vessels are relatively bright and nerves are relatively dim. This image is then subtracted from a second image obtained using a long TE and exhibiting bright nerves and dim vessels. A third blood vessel suppression technique involves the administration of an intravenous \"black blood\" contrast agent to the vessels. The agent is preferably (but not necessarily) of the \"blood pool\" type including dysprosium-DOTA poly lysine or iron oxide type contrast agent. The blood vessels are thereby blacked out by the pharmaceutical agent so there is no need for a subtraction step to produce the desired vessel-suppressed neurogram. Finally, carefully adjusted water suppression techniques can be used to limit the contribution of the blood vessels and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) to the neural image generated by system 14. One such technique is fluid-attenuated, inversion recovery (FLAIR), described in, for example, Bydde et al., Comparison of FLAIR Pulse Sequences with Heavily T2 Weighted SE Sequences in MR Imaging of the Brain, 185 RADIOLOGY SUPP. 151 (1992). (b) Motion Suppression Some of the image processing techniques described above, including, for example, the use of diffusion weighting, may be adversely influenced by motion of the region being imaged. To limit the introduction of ambiguous or erroneous content into the images produced (i.e., motion artifact), several different hardware and software features may be employed by the neurography system 14. As shown in FIG. 19, the acquisition of image information can be electively carried out with the region of the patient under examination immobilized by a splint 156. The splint 156 includes a rigid base 158, made of plastic or some other non-ferro-magnetic material. Base 158 is included to provide a fixed frame of reference for the region under examination and is designed to be optionally rigidly secured within the bore of the imager I. As will be described in greater detail below, once the neurography system 10 has imaged the region, the reference frame provided by base 158 allows another system, like surgical system 28, to operate within that reference frame in a known relationship to the imaged nerves. A non-rigid system, described below, employs fiduciary markers applied to the skin surface within the splint. A rigid frame 160, made of plastic or some other non-ferromagnetic material, is attached to base 158 and provides structural support for the splint 156. One or more fiduciary markers 162, e.g. water-filled beads or linear marker strips, are provided on the frame 160 and/or base 158 to allow the relationship of frame 160 and base 158 relative to the imaged region to be determined from the images generated. In the preferred arrangement, each marker 162 extends the length of splint 156, so that it is visible in each cross sectional image generated. At least one of the markers or strips 162 is aligned at a non-zero angle to the x, y, and z axes of the image plane, ensuring that its particular location in the image provides a positional reference to the splint. A sleeve 164, made of a thin film plastic and filled with a conformable substance 166, such as water containing gel, silicone, foam, or cobalt-chloride doped water, is formed around the frame 160 and includes straps 168 for use in attaching the splint to the patient. As shown, the frame 160 and sleeve 164 include a number of open regions 170, providing access to select areas of the region under examination by, for example, surgical system 28. Alternatively, the base 158 may be used with two sleeves. A first such sleeve provides complete and continuous skin contact for imaging, while a second sleeve secures the arm but generally allows access by a surgical device. A pump 172 is included to allow the fluid to be introduced into sleeve 164 from a reservoir 174 under pressure, forcing the sleeve against the patient's skin and immobilizing the region under examination. A release valve 176, allows the fluid within the sleeve 164 to return to the reservoir 174, relieving pressure within sleeve 164. In addition to reducing motion artifacts, the splint 156 performs several other functions. First, as suggested above, the splint 156 provides a reference frame that can be used by other components of medical system 12 to ensure that actions are taken in proper relationship to an imaged neural network. Second, the splint 156 may be required to keep the region under examination immobilized for the successful administration of therapy or performance of surgery by system 12. A third function of splint 156 is the reduction of edge effects that might otherwise be experienced using fat suppression. In that regard, the surface of a region under examination (i.e, the patient's skin) presents an abrupt transition in the nature of the material being imaged. The field inhomogeneity caused by this tissue-to-air interface causes the fat signals in the patient's surface adipose tissue to spread out and/or shift in frequency relative to deeper lying fat surrounding the nerve. The desired effect of fat suppression is, however, to suppress the signal from the underlying tissue adjacent the neural tissue to be imaged. By employing thin flexible polyethylene or other plastic for sleeve 164 and paramagnetically doped water for substance 166, these edge effects introduced at the surface of the region under examination are reduced on the order of 1.5 to 5 for nerve tissues. Additionally, the splint can be specially designed to move a particular body region during an imaging series to introduce serial stepped repositionings of the limb. The movement can be controlled externally by a hydraulic system with fiber optic feedbacks to assess repositioning. In this fashion, it is possible to collect a series of images with the limb in a controlled series of positions. These can be later assembled to provide a kinematic view of stress or impingements upon a nerve during motion as for the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Motion artifact can also be addressed by the software used to control neurography system 10. In that regard, to ensure adequate echo amplitude for MRI, the net magnetic moment generated by one pulse sequence typically must be allowed to return near its equilibrium value before the next pulse sequence is initiated. This factor, in combination with the sheer number of sequences typically required for imaging, typically causes data collection to occur over a relatively long period of time (e.g., on the order of 1 to 20 minutes or longer). As will be appreciated, the likelihood that significant patient motion will be experienced during the data collection process increases in direct proportion to the time required for data collection. The software controlling the data collection processed is optimized to reduce at least some of the delays contributing to motion artifact sensitivity. In the arrangement described above, information from a number of different images may be used to selectively produce a final image. For example, the subtraction neurogram is typically generated on a pixel-by-pixel (or voxel-by-voxel) basis using information from two images obtained with orthogonal diffusion gradients. By interleaving the image sequence so that data for a given pixel is collected for each diffusional gradient before collecting data for any other pixel, the susceptibility of the subtraction process to motion artifact is reduced. Similarly, where multiple images are collected at different gradient strengths to compute the diffusion coefficient D for a given pixel or voxel, as part of the gradient selection process, the susceptibility of the computation to motion artifact can be reduced by collecting data for all gradient strengths at one pixel before data for other pixels is collected. Thus, despite the relatively simple data collection process depicted in FIGS. 9 and 10, in the preferred arrangement, data collection is interleaved by collecting data in several planes at each acquisition rather than completely collecting all repetitions for a given plane before proceeding to the next. Another technique used to provide the desired motion suppression is based upon the anticipation of certain periodic sources of motion that can be monitored by, for example, the auxiliary data collection system 22. For example, depending upon the region of the patient under examination, the patient's heartbeat and respiration may introduce some motion that is not suppressed by the splint 156. With information regarding the periodicity of these sources available from system 22, computer 72 may then adjust the data collection sequence so that the excitation and echo pulses occur at consistent times relative to the motion introduced by the sources. One technique for reducing respiratory motion artifact in MRI is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,508 (Shimoni et al.). In contrast, the neurography system 10 can be used with a variety of techniques including mass-spectrometer monitoring of carbon dioxide output, fiber-optic observation at chest wall movement, or auditory monitoring by long tube stethoscope with automated sound analysis. (c) Fascicle Identification and Nerve Enhancement Another feature of the neurography system 10 is its ability to image individual nerve fascicles. For example, when a phased array coil 62, or other high resolution MRI system is used with a long TE sequence, individual nerve fascicles appear much brighter than the perineural and epineural tissue within the nerve and between the fascicles, and the nerve takes on the appearance of a multifascicled structure. By way of illustration, neural images depicting fascicles in the nerve of a patient having a nerve graft are provided in FIGS. 20, 21, and 22. These images were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla MRI system (Signa System 5.2 software release, sold by GE Medical Systems) with standard 1 Gauss/cm gradients and a phased array RF coil system of the type described above. A \"fast\" spin-echo sequence with a TR of 5000 ms, TE of 102 ms, and 8 echo train was used with fat suppression and spatial RF pulses for vessel suppression. Two axial series of images were produced using a two dimensional Fourier transformation. The first series consisted of 24, five mm thick sections, a 512\u00d7512 matrix, one mm skip, and one nex (number of excitations). The second series consisted of 41, three mm thick axial sections, a 256\u00d7256 matrix, zero mm skip, and two nex. The field of view was 18 cm and acquisition time was 10.6 minutes for both series. Images from the second series were post-processed by selecting (manually) an elliptical region of interest, approximately two cm in diameter, around the sciatic nerve in each of the sections. This region of interest was selected to exclude blood vessels, without requiring the use of the more analytically complex vessel suppression features described above. Projectional images were obtained using a maximum intensity projection (MIP) algorithm, available as part of System 5.t (IVI) provided by GE Medical Systems. The resultant neurograms show the interface between the tibial component of the sciatic nerve and the surgically placed sural nerve graft, with FIGS. 20 and 21 illustrating the nerve in progressively larger scale and FIG. 22 illustrating an axial projection of the nerve including graft g. As an additional benefit, this imaging protocol depresses the signal from tissues within the nerve, between and among the fascicles, so that the individual fascicles (f) of the nerve stand out in sharp profile. The ability of the neurography system 10 to image fascicles is important for several reasons. First, fascicle imaging enhances the diagnostic usefulness of the neurogram because it makes it possible to observe and analyze the internal structure of the nerve for evidence of disease. As will be appreciated, this observation and analysis may be performed visually by the operator or automatically, as part of the operation of the diagnostic system 24 described in greater detail below. Second, this unique internal organization can be used to provide neural selectivity and enhancement in the imaging process, even when the conspicuity or signal intensity of a particular nerve does not permit identification. More particularly, blood vessels, lymphatics, lymph nodes and collections of adipose tissue, are often similar to nerve in shape, location, and intensity in the cross-sectional images. None of these features, however, exhibit the internal fascicular structure of nerve. By way of illustration, fascicle identification and nerve confirmation may be used to distinguish nerve from other structures in an ambiguous image in the following manner. First, a thresholding process is used to identify relatively bright regions of the image potentially representative of nerve. With the boundaries of these regions established, the intensity of the pixels associated with each region is evaluated and average image intensities for the regions are computed. If the intensity of a given pixel within a region is more than some predetermined amount below the average intensity, the structure associated with that pixel is a potential fascicle. A positive fascicle identification is, however, only made if one or more of a plurality of predetermined sequences of such pixel groups representative of fascicular structure are identified. For example, a group of at least 3 such pixels must be found which are adjacent each other and bounded on at least one side by pixels not satisfying this criteria. The results of this analysis can be used to distinguish bright regions associated with nerve from those associated with, for example, blood vessels or lymphatics. The image intensity of regions not satisfying the fascicular identification parameters may then be adjusted to zero, effectively eliminating these ambiguous structures from the image. Alternatively, a neuroradiologist or other specialist may use this information to select a volume of interest which the neurography system can then render into a projection neurogram. (d) Miscellaneous Nerve Enhancement Techniques The various embodiments and features of the neurography system 10 described above can be modified to incorporate alternative approaches to nerve identification and enhancement. For example, a magnetization transfer pulse sequence can be employed after the fat suppression sequence to enhance neural imaging. Magnetization transfer involves the excitation of chemically shifted protons with an \"off resonance\" pulse. These protons in a short T2 isotropically diffusing water compartment then exchange into a long T2 anisotropically diffusing compartment. In doing so, they carry the high intensity magnetization signal with them, thus inducing a transfer of magnetization to surrounding neural tissue to increase its conspicuity in the image. Nerve may exhibit efficient exchange between the off-resonance, relatively stationary protons in the myelin sheath and the resonant, mobile protons of axoplasmic water. On the other hand, muscle does not exhibit exchange with a large off-resonant proton pool to a comparable degree. The magnetization transfer pulse sequence is designed to exploit this differential sensitivity between nerve and muscle by using stimulation methods similar to fat suppression to synergistically improve the neurographic selectivity of the image in two ways simultaneously. Other alternative pulse sequences can also be used. For example, a version of steady state free precession (SSFP), as described in Patz et al., The Application of Steady-State Free Precession to the Study of Very Slow Fluid Flow, 3 MAG. RES. MED. 140-145 (1986), can be used. The SSFP is, however, modified to be included in an imaging protocol to achieve fat suppression. Similarly, a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence, as described in Mugler et al., Three Dimensional Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo Imaging (3D MP RAGE), 15 MAG. RES. MED. 152-157 (1990) can be used if modified to improve T2 contrast. In addition, neural selectivity can be achieved by employing proton fast exchange rates or T1 relaxation rates. Further alternative techniques for generating neurograms employ sequences optimized to be sensitive to the slow coherent flow of the endoneurial fluid. These sequences provides a unique signal because of the proximal to distal direction of flow and because of the slow flow rate which can be monitored by techniques originally developed to distinguish diffusion from perfusion. Such techniques include, for example, velocity compensation by gradient moment nulling as described in Ehman et al., Flow Artifact Reduction in MRI: A Review of the Roles of Gradient Moment Nulling and Spatial Pre-saturation, 14 MAG. RES. MED. 293-307 (1990) and Moran, A Flow Velocity Zeumatographic Interface for NMR Imaging, 1 MAG. RES. IM. 197-203 (1982). 3. Medical System Construction and Operation As noted previously, the neurography system 10 is one component of a broader medical system 12. The remaining components of system 12 are described in greater detail in the following sections. These components provide information to, and process information from, neurography system 10 in accordance with software instructions executed by, for example, a host processing system 32 or the processing systems of individual components of the system 12 to achieve a variety of functions beyond the imaging of peripheral nerve. a. Auxiliary Data Collection System The auxiliary data collection system 22 may take any one of a variety of different forms. For example, as suggested above, system 22 may be designed to collect supplemental information regarding structure present within the images produced by system 10. Examples of such systems include a secondary MRI system, employing conventional pulse-echo sequences suitable for use in angiography or STIR sequences to show areas of high muscle signal due to denervations or functional loss of the muscle; an X-ray imaging system suitable for use in generating image data of bone and/or tissue, a PET scanning system for showing the progress of an axionally transported pharmaceutical agent; or a CT system for collecting contrast agent lymphography data. The splint 156 is also formed with fiduciary markers visible using CT and MRI (e.g., iodine contrast material in water), allowing the information from systems 10 and 22 to be integrated. The supplemental information may be used to suppress structural content in the image and provide greater neural selectivity. For example, an angiogram may be used to remove vessel image content from the neurogram or to distinguish nerve and vessels on the basis of color. Alternatively, because non-neural structure is generally absent in the image anyway, the additional information may be employed to add specific structures, such as blood vessels, back into the neurogram unambiguously. This process allows alternative structure to be readily differentiated using different colors to display information from different sources. As will be appreciated, the addition of structure into a MR image viewed to assess neural structure was virtually unthinkable with prior art systems due to the low signal content of neural return components. An alternative type of data collection system 22 is employed to collect information about the patient for use in controlling the operation of the neurography system 10, rather than modifying its output. Examples of such systems include conventional heart rate and respiration monitors, used to time the data collection sequencing of system 10 relative to the heart rate and respiration of the patient. A final type of data collection system 22 of interest is one designed to collect supplemental information about the neural network. For example, system 22 may be constructed to produce an output indicative of nerve conduction velocity (NCV), including the approximate location of a change in NCV or the NCV response to magnetic stimulation. Information from evoked potential electrodes or magnetic SQUID detectors might also be collected and integrated for a multi-input display. b. Diagnostic System The diagnostic system 24 is selected to process the image neurograms and other information (such as D and T2) provided by neurography system 10 to provide an attending physician with, for example, diagnoses of neural anomalies. Alternatively, system 24 may assist the physician in making a diagnosis, or assessing the need for, or likely success of, surgery. In one embodiment, system 24 may be employed simply to confirm or question the physician's diagnoses. By way of illustration, one region in which problematic neural disorders commonly occur but are difficult to diagnose is the spinal canal. As shown in the cross sectional view of one vertebra provided in FIG. 23, the region of interest exhibits a relatively high physiological complexity. The illustrated structures include a herniated disc (HD), compressed left spinal root (LSR), spinous process (SP), anulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), autonomic ganglion (AG), left ventral root (LVR), ventral ramus (VRA), transverse process (TP), dorsal ramus (DRA), dorsal root ganglion (DRG), facet (F), dorsal root (DRO), extradural fat (EF), root in cauda equina (RCE), dural sac (DS), and cerebrospinal fluid (CF). In this diagram, the two features of primary interest are the left spinal root (LSR) and the left ventral root (LVR), which are both in risk of compression from the herniating disc (HD). Both nerves are traveling through extradural fat (EF) but are surrounded by bone, which could impair observation by an X-ray based technique. Both nerves are also near the strong water signal of the disc (HD), cerebrospinal fluid (CF) in the dural sac (DS), and other inflamed tissue (which often diminishes image resolution and quality in generally used magnetic resonance techniques). The left spinal root (LSR) and left ventral root (LVR) of diagnostic interest are small relative to the numerous large anatomic structures nearby. Also, these roots are nearly perpendicular to each other. This common imaging problem can be addressed by the use of a neurography system 10 programmed to employ fat suppression, followed by pulsed diffusion gradients oriented to enhance either the left spinal root (LSR) or left ventral root (LVR), so that each can be clearly seen in a given image. If either root is compressed, its image will demonstrate physical distortion or an imprint due to the compression, which may manifest itself as a change in structure or signal intensity between the two sides of a compression. As will be appreciated, due to the selectivity and resolution of the neurograms produced by system 10, they can be evaluated by a physician to diagnose any neural abnormalities present. In addition, the image produced by system 10 can be analyzed by diagnostic system 24 to detect, for example, evidence of compression or inflammation and provide the appropriate diagnosis. The operation of system 24 depends, in part, upon the condition to be evaluated. In one embodiment, the operator initially views a two- or three-dimensional image generated on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display, included with system 24 and uses a cursor to identify a particular imaged nerve to be evaluated. The operator may also input the particular types of anomalies to be detected. The system 24 then determines the boundaries of the imaged nerve in each of the two dimensional images available, using a thresholding process. These boundaries can then be compared from one image to the next to look for discontinuities or changes in shape associated with a particular anomaly of interest. For example, if this analysis were used with a nerve severed in an accident, the nerve might disappear entirely from certain images in which it would otherwise be expected to appear. The system 24 is able to readily identify such regions and provide the physician with precise locational information regarding the anomaly. Similarly, the physician may be interested in conditions associated with less pronounced changes in nerve boundary or intensity. The system 24 is readily able to provide outputs indicative of the average intensity of a bounded neural area, as well as the size and shape of the bounded area on an image-by-image basis. This information can then be used to detect anomalies such as compressions. In one arrangement, a cursor can be used to initialize a reference boundary of interest on the CRT (e.g., associated with a \"normal\" neural cross section) for use by system 24. System 24 then compares the actual boundary of the nerve in subsequent images to the reference boundary to locate and quantify the extent of neural compressions. This quantification of an anomaly then allows the physician to monitor the recovery of the nerve and assess the effectiveness of any therapy being provided. Another approach that may be employed by system 24, is based upon the apparent increase in T2 exhibited by injured nerve. More particularly, an initial \"long T2 \" analysis or diffusion weighted image can be performed to image all neural structures. Then T2 can be extended to roughly 100 milliseconds to image only those nerves that are injured. An additional approach for use in the manual evaluation of, for example, bone fractures and injuries to joints, involves the analysis of an image in which the fat component is selectively demonstrated and remaining tissues suppressed. This approach emphasizes the appearance of skin, adipose collections, and of bone (in many locations) due to the presence of marrow. When such an image is collected and assigned a color other than that used to display nerve, the two images can be shown transparently in the same three dimensional construction. As a result, the physician is provided with useful information regarding the physical relationship between nerves and bones. This information is most important in the evaluation and treatment of bone fractures and joint injuries. In some applications, a contrast agent may be used to synergistically highlight the anomaly of interest. Alternatively, because nerves appear bright and isolated in an image, it may be more informative to selectively black out one of the nerves by means of administering an intraneural pharmaceutical contrast agent. In addition to analyzing the output of neurography system 10, the diagnostic system 24 may also provide feedback to system 10 to control the pulse sequences used and the type of information produced. For example, where sites of nerve compression, section, laceration, or fibrosis are imaged, the alteration in endoneurial fluid flow and in axoplasmic flow are readily detected by monitoring the increase in signal intensity when T2 -based, or other, neurographic sequences are used. Although not described in detail herein, a variety of different diagnostic applications are contemplated including: 1. The demonstration of a patient's peripheral, cranial, and autonomic nerve and nerve plexus anatomy. 2. The demonstration of a patient's spinal root anatomy, particularly the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal roots and nerves where they pass through fat at the foramina through which they exit the spinal canal. 3. The demonstration of a patient's spinal root anatomy within the lumbar canal where the roots pass through quantities of extradural fat. 4. The examination of a patient's cranial nerves for compressions by vessels or other structures which could cause trigeminal neuralgia (Vth nerve), hemifacial spasm or Bell's palsy (VIIth nerve), essential hypertension (Xth nerve) or other cranial nerve syndromes. 5. The demonstration of nerve, plexus or root compressions or injuries in a patient, where abnormal changes in the direction, position, or other diffusional properties are caused by an injurious process, such as nerve transection, demyelinating diseases, neuritis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies and crush injuries, as well as the monitoring of the regrowth of nerves. 6. The determination of the location of tumors or other masses within the spinal cord where it is useful to know the position of cortico-spinal motor tracts or other functional white matter long tracts relative to some abnormality. 7. Demonstrating the anatomy of the optic nerve, an extension of the brain, where it passes through the peri-orbital fat or other fat on its route to the retina. 8. Tract tracing within the brain to provide useful images for study by radiologists, surgeons or physicians and, in particular, for identification of the location of areas of `eloquent cortex` such as the motor strip, or speech-related areas. This method involves the spatial identification of relevant areas of the thalamus or internal capsule and then following projecting tracts to the area of interest on the cortical surface, or identifying regions of interest by reference to their connections with other areas on the cortical surface. For example, speech cortex projection tracts can be followed from areas known to be involved in speech production to (and through) other areas where an injury or stroke may have blocked proper nerve function. 9. Tracing of nerves as they pass through tumors of low diffusional anisotropy, such as the passage of the VIIth nerve through an acoustic neuroma to permit a surgeon to know the location of the nerve in or near the tumor and so to have the ability to avoid the nerve during surgery on the tumor. 10. Application of diffusion anisotropy imaging for the evaluation of diffuse axonal injury, as may occur in head injury. 11. The evaluation of bone fractures and joint dislocations or dislocation/fractures in which surgical planning, management and fixation would benefit from knowing the course of the nerve in the region of the abnormal anatomy. c. Therapeutic System As noted previously, a therapeutic system 26 is also employed to process information from neurography system 10 or other components of medical system 12 to better effect the administration of therapy to the patient. For example, system 26 may be a drug-delivery system or a current-stimulation system that employs feedback from neurography system 10 to regulate its operation. In this fashion, more precise nerve conduction velocity (NCV) or evoked potential tests can be done using neurographic data to place stimulating or recording electrodes. For therapy, tract information could aid in the placement of transplant tissue or for lesions of areas of abnormal activity that might cause tremor in the thalamus. d. Surgical System The surgical system 28 employs neurographic information from system 10 to influence any one of a variety of surgical operations that may be performed. The information obtained may be used to avoid neural paths during surgery or to confirm the location and nature of neural surgery required. The operation of surgical system 28 may be automatically controlled in response to feedback from system 10 or may manually controlled by a surgeon based upon his or her review of the information provided. In one embodiment, the region of the patient that is to undergo surgery is placed in the splint 156 described above. The open regions 170 of splint 156 need to be designed and positioned to ensure that splint 156 will not interfere with the surgical system 28 during the performance of an operation. With the splint 156 applied, image data is then collected via the neurography system 10. As noted previously, the processing system 16 of neurography system 10 provides numerical coordinates, in three dimensions, describing the position of the nerves along their courses with reference to the splint base 158 and fiduciary markers 162. Depending upon the nature of the operation to be performed, outputs from the auxiliary data collection system 22 may also be required. For example, if system 28 is employed to operate on bone within the region imaged, system 22 may be called upon to generate a fat selective image of the bone, or the patient may be brought to a C-T scanner for preparation of a bone image. The MRI splint 156 will be worn while this additional information is collected, but additional markers (e.g., chalk or iodine solution for CT X-rays) are required to extract locational information from the secondary image and, hence, provide the requisite registration between the two images generated. The image information is loaded into the memory of a surgical system processor 178, shown in FIG. 24. As will be described in greater detail below, in the preferred arrangement, processor 178 is programmed to guide surgical operations performed in a coordinate system that is referenced to the image coordinate system. The base 158 of splint 156 is secured to a platform 180 included in surgical system 28 to provide a fixed relationship between the coordinate systems used in the image and by system 28. The coordinate systems are then linked by processor 178 using a computer model of three-dimensional space. Confirmatory X-rays may be taken conveniently during the procedure to assure correct positioning of the markers. An articulated surgical arm 182 is coupled to the platform 180 and has a stylus 184 (e.g., a surgical apparatus, such as a focused laser beam or a drill) provided at its free end. The arm 182 can be moved electrically or pneumatically to any select point, or along any select path, defined relative to the operating environment in response to outputs from processor 178. The position of the arm 182 can, thus, be tracked via the control outputs applied by the processor 178. As will be appreciated, a separate coordinate-based or laser-based positioning system may be employed if desired. In the preferred embodiment, the position of the stylus relative to the imaged neural and other networks is illustrated on a system display 186 during the course of a surgical operation. The surgeon may manually guide the stylus 184 during the operation via, for example, a joystick, electronic glove, or other input device 188, visually monitoring the position of the stylus relative to anatomical structure. This visual feedback may be based simply upon a comparison of the known positional relationship of the stylus to the previously collected image. Alternatively, it is possible to obtain visual confirmation using imaging feedback data collected in real time. For instance, with the use of high-speed MRI data collection sequences, such as echo planar imaging described in Worthington et al., The Clinical Applications of Echo Planar Imaging in Neuroradiology, 32 NEURORADIOLOGY 367-370 (1990), it is possible to rapidly update images. When the resulting images are displayed, the surgeon may observe the progression of an appropriately labeled, non-magnetic probe into the body in real time. If a slower image collection process is employed, the probe or device is advanced in steps as a series of images are taken. In either case, the neurographic image provides the surgeon with apparent vision of sensitive neural tissue inside opaque, solid body structures, in much the same manner as fluoroscopy, but while also providing information regarding neural paths. As an alternative to requiring the surgeon to control the operation of system 28 during surgery, a computer-guided, stereotaxic, or fiduciary system may be employed. In that regard, the surgeon may provide processor 178 with input identifying the nature of the operation to be performed, including the stylus path and operation appropriate for the surgery to be performed. These steps can be performed with the arm 182 disengaged, allowing the surgeon to simulate the operation and view the stylus path on the image, before the surgical procedure is confirmed. Once confirmed, the processor 178 can then be instructed to automatically guide the arm 182 over the desired path during the actual surgical operation. The use of surgical system 28 has a number of important advantages over the \"neurally blind\" surgical methods currently employed. For example, because nerves are readily imaged, the surgeon is better able to assess any neural conditions that might require treatment or alter the surgical plan. In addition, because the position of the stylus 182 relative to nerve is readily imaged and can be confirmed before an operation is performed, accidental intrusion of the stylus upon neural paths is avoided. Although a splint 156 is employed in the embodiment described above to provide a link between the referential frames of the neurogram and surgical system 28, it is not mandatory. For example, particularly in regions that are relatively unsusceptible to motion artifact, fiduciary markers can be applied directly to the body (e.g., on the head or face when nerves of facial sensation or movement are involved, or adjacent the iliac crests and lumbar vertebral spinous processes when lumbar nerve roots are involved). The use of a computer-guided surgical system 28 employing such fiduciary markers is believed to be of particular importance in cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine surgery. In that regard, system 28 will eliminate the problem of doing a \"good\" operation but at the wrong level, e.g., inadvertently decompressing the lumbar 3/4 root when the symptomatic compression to be relieved was actually at the lumbar 4/5 root. For spine work, the original image can be collected with a strip of fiduciary markers taped to the patient's back and independently marked in a manner that can be sensed by system 28 to allow location of the stylus 182 during surgery. As will be appreciated, the various components of the surgical system 28 can be altered in a variety of manners. For example, the stylus 182 may include a surface detector of electrical fields or a magnetic detector of nerve activity, constructed to detect the activity of nerves. Examples of such devices include a somatosensory evoked potential or magneto-encephalography system. As a result, the detection of nerves offered by embodiment of the stylus 182 allows the position of the stylus relative to nerve determined by reference to the neurogram to be confirmed. One application for surgical system 28 that is of particular importance is in surgery of the neck. Surgery of this type includes, for example, a carotid endarterectomy to remove stroke producing plaque from the internal carotid artery, an anterior cervical discectomy to relieve a cervical root compression, or an operation for cancer in the neck. One of the most common complications of such surgery is the accidental crushing or transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, possibly resulting in permanent paralysis of one or both sets of vocal cords. Optimally, a preoperative neurographic image is used to demonstrate the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, allowing the surgeon to more effectively avoid it or at least identify and protect it during surgery. Neurographic guidance can be also used for percutaneous needle biopsy of lesions, or for the placement of more elaborate percutaneous systems such as ultrasonic or other mechanical devices used to remove tissues. By way of illustration, such operations include discectomies, the introduction of laser/suction systems, the placement of RF lesioning devices used in procedures such as gangliolysis of the fifth cranial nerve, the placement of probes to carry out deep tissue localized drug administration, diathermy, cryotherapy, or other physical or mechanical techniques. Neurographic guidance may also be used to control the passage of rigid endoscopes through solid tissues or to guide the placement of directable flexible endoscopes. Yet another important application of surgical system 28 is in the use of CNS neurograms to guide stereotactic surgery in the brain. Currently, tissue structures visible by virtue of their T1 or T2 MRI are used to guide stereotactic surgery. In contrast, CNS neurograms provide information concerning the connections or relation of specific tracts of interest, which may travel in or among other tracts from which they cannot be differentiated by means of conventional tissue-based images. e. Training and Development System The training and development system 30 may take any one of a variety of forms designed to process information collected from the neurography system 10. In one embodiment, neurographic images are collected from a plurality of patients to produce an anatomical atlas of normal and abnormal neural paths for reference by surgeons and others. Images obtained from a patient can be compared to the clinically known population in the atlas to rapidly identify anomalous nerve courses in a patient set to undergo surgery for some condition. As a result, the surgeon may be able to modify his or her technique to reduce the risk of injury to nerves which happen to be in the field of surgery. Similarly, a neurographic map of an individual patient's skin and cutaneous nerves can be used to help the surgeon plan incisions that avoid the very common complication of accidental transection of cutaneous nerves in the course of routine surgical incision to reach structures below the skin. In another embodiment, the training and development system 30 may be designed to assess the effectiveness of the programming employed by neurography system 10 and may provide feedback to system 10 to regulate its operation and enhance the quality of the neurograms generated. More particularly, once a sequence able to positively identify nerve has been employed, alternative sequences can be employed and their results compared to the confirmed method. As a result, a collection of techniques can be established and programmed into neurography system, along with the conditions under which each sequence offers the best performance. Another alternative training and development system 30 may be employed to assess the effectiveness of intraneural, pharmaceutical contrast agents designed to help in the diagnosis of nerve compressions. More particularly, such a training system 30 is used to quantify the image contrast produced using different contrast agents to image known neural anomalies. As a result, system 30 is able to identify those agents providing the best results for particular neural imaging problems. Yet another embodiment of training and development system 30 allows information from neurograms to be used in the design of any of a variety of products. For example, the neurograms produced by system 10 provide information that is of great advantage to designers of ergonomic furniture, high gravity air or space craft seats, specialized body suits, boots, and various kinds of electronic or electric medical equipment, which can be best used when the positions of nerves can be precisely located in advance. The system 30 incorporates information regarding neural paths from system 10 into the computational processes involved in designing such equipment to provide enhanced product performance. As one illustration, in the ergonomic design of a chair, system 30 would be programmed to ensure that the primary support provided by the chair does not coincide with a neural path in the relevant customer population. This can be done by superimposing the neural network of a sitting person upon a mathematical model of the chair, identifying the primary points of support, and generating flags on the display for any support points that are within some predetermined distance of a nerve. As a result, the chair design can be manipulated to avoid neural compressions. In another application, the system 30 can be used to control electronic prosthesis. More particularly, the information from system 10 can be used to locate electronic detectors adjacent, for example, a severed nerve to detect neural activity associated with the limb replaced by the prosthesis. The detected activity of the nerve is then used to control the prothesis. 4. Non-neural Imaging Applications In principle, selective imaging of any other object or subject may be effected using the MRI techniques described above, if that subject or object exhibits characteristics corresponding to the neural characteristics described above. For example, objects exhibiting diffusion anisotropy in any part thereof can be imaged using diffusional weighting. Thus, in medicine, for example, the cardiovascular system could also be imaged in this fashion and the technique can also be employed to examine, for example, rock strata and plants, if they exhibit diffusion anisotropy. 5. Conclusion The lack of a suitable method for creating a distinct image of the nerves has been a great hindrance to physicians, surgeons, athletic trainers, and pain treatment specialists. Although, previously, it has sometimes been possible to make a nerve stand out from immediately surrounding structures, the unique ability of system 10 to make the nerve stand out from all other structures represents a significant advance. The sensitivity of the system 10 allows even the smallest nerves to be accurately identified and linked to form three-dimensional projections of a neural network. The neurographic information can be collected rapidly, without requiring contrast agents. While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.",

        "Description": "Description CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/746,900 filed May 10, 2007, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to a Korean application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 28, 2006 and allocated Ser. No. 2006-118143, the teachings and entire disclosures of which applications are fully incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to a magnetic anisotropy multilayer used in a magnetic random access memory, and more particularly, to a magnetic anisotropy multilayer including a plurality of CoFeSiB/Pt layers. BACKGROUND A magnetic random access memory (hereinafter, referred to as a magnetic memory) is being used in military applications such as a missile, a spacecraft, and the like. The magnetic memory has advantages of volatile devices such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and a static random access memory (SRAM), i.e., both high integration degree of a DRAM and high-speed performance of an SRAM. In addition, the magnetic memory has lower power consumption than a nonvolatile type flash memory, and it has great number of repetition times of record reproduction. Therefore, it is considered as a substitution for the existing memory that has been used in a mobile phone, a computer and a network. Also, attempts are being made to apply the magnetic memory to a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag requiring low price and volatility, and further there is a great likelihood that it can be applied to a robot for factory automation. The magnetic memory is a magnetic memory device having magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). The magnetic memory can input data by using spin directions caused by self-revolution of electrons in the device. In detail, the resistance of the magnetic memory is changed according as the spin directions of adjacent magnetic layers become parallel or anti-parallel, and the spin direction can be controlled to be parallel or anti-parallel by applying a magnetic field from the exterior. By using this property, it is possible to input data in the magnetic memory. In general, the MTJ is configured in the shape of a sandwich where an insulating layer (generally, Al2O3 or MgO layer) as a tunneling barrier is interposed between two ferromagnetic layers. A current flows perpendicular to each layer. One of the two ferromagnetic layers is a pinned layer acting as a reference layer and the other one is a free layer for magnetic recording or sensing. In case that the spin directions of the two ferromagnetic layers are parallel with each other when current flows, the resistance becomes small so that the tunneling probability of current becomes great. On the contrary, when the spin directions of the two ferromagnetic layers are anti-parallel, the resistance becomes large, which results in reducing the tunneling probability of current. For ultra high integration of the magnetic memory, it should be necessary to form submicron memory cells. If a unit MTJ shrinks in size and an aspect ratio of the cell is also reduced for achieving the high integration degree of the magnetic memory, multi-domains or a vortex is formed inside a magnetic substance of the MTJ due to strong diamagnetic field. This leads to an unstable cell-switching phenomenon, which decreases a writing margin. When fabricating the cell with high aspect ratio, such a multi-domain structure is not formed in virtue of shape magnetic anisotropy but it is difficult to achieve high integration. Moreover, this requires high switching magnetic field so that it is impossible to highly integrate the device after all. To overcome such a problem, a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MTJ has been developed (Naoki Nishimura et al., J. Appl. Phys., vol. 91, p. 5246. 2002). In Nishimura et al., the MTJ was fabricated using rare-earth and transition-metal alloys such as TbFeCo and GdFeCo, which has been well known as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy material, as a free layer and a pinned layer, respectively. The magnetoresistance ratio of this MTJ was 55%. In addition, it was confirmed that there was no susceptibility distortion at the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MTJ through a magnetic force microscope (MFM). However, Tb and Gd used in this experiment are disadvantageous in terms of low corrosion resistance and difficulty in property control, and thus it is not easy to put these elements into the practical use. Therefore, for practical use of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MTJ (in short, pMTJ), it is necessary to develop new perpendicular magnetic anisotropy material. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layers that have been researched were developed in order that they may be substituted for longitudinal magnetic storage media which will encounter the limitation of high density. The material exhibiting the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is CoCr-based alloy layer, Co/Pt, or Co/Pd multilayer, wherein this material should meet specific physical properties such as high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high coercivity and high remanent magnetization. However, as the magnetic memory needs rapid switching and low power consumption, low coercivity and high magnetic anisotropy for the increase of a writing margin are required. In addition, it is required to maintain a remanent magnetization to be similar to a saturation magnetization and simultaneously to be low for improving the sensitivity of the magnetic memory switching operation. In order to employ a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) that has been actively researched to meet the demand for high integration of the magnetic memory, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer exhibiting low coercivity, low saturation magnetization and high magnetic anisotropy should be used. That is, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MTJ formed of the above-listed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy material, in which the magnetization direction is perpendicular to the layer surface, has low saturation magnetization and no magnetic distortion at an edge of the layer, which will make it possible to realize the high integration of the magnetic memory. Accordingly, it is required a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer having a low coercivity and a low saturation magnetization similar to a remanent magnetization, and capable of minimizing power consumption as well. SUMMARY An object of the present disclosure is to substantially solve at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below. Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a magnetic anisotropy layer having a low coercivity and a low saturation magnetization or smaller similar to a remanent magnetization. Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a CoFeSiB/Pt magnetic anisotropy layer having a low coercivity (20 Oe or smaller) and a low saturation magnetization (172 emu/cm3) similar to a remanent magnetization (squareness\u22481). Further another object of the present disclosure is to provide a magnetic anisotropy layer configured with CoFeSiB/Pt multilayers having a low coercivity (20 Oe or smaller) and a low saturation magnetization (172 emu/cm3) similar to a remanent magnetization (squareness\u22481). According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy multilayer includes: a first Pt/CoFeSiB layer; and a second Pt/CoFeSiB layer formed on the first Pt/CoFeSiB layer. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) including a free layer and a pinned layer separated by a non-magnetic spacer layer (tunnel barrier), wherein the free layer includes: a first Pt/CoFeSiB layer; and a second Pt/CoFeSiB layer formed on the first Pt/CoFeSiB layer. In addition, there may be provided other embodiments having structures different from the above magnetic anisotropy multilayer, or other embodiments realized by modifying and adding elements. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a multi-stacked structure of CoFeSiB/Pt perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer according to the present disclosure; FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating the comparison of magnetic properties between an existing Co/Pt layer and the CoFeSiB/Pt formed according to the present disclosure; FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of Pt thickness (t) in Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt (t)/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom); FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of number of repetition times (n) in Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d7n/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom); and FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of CoFeSiB thickness (x) in Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB (x)]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom). DETAILED DESCRIPTION Preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the disclosure in unnecessary detail. A multi-stacked structure of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy multilayer according to the present disclosure is represented as Si/SiO2/Ta/Pt/[Pt/CoFeSiB]\u00d7n/Ta, where Si denotes a substrate, SiO2 is a native oxide layer formed on the substrate, and Ta and Pt layers are buffer layers. The other Ta layer is a capping layer. The subject of the present disclosure is [Pt/CoFeSiB] layer exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. That is, the CoFeSiB layer is used in the present disclosure instead of the Pt/Co or Pt/CoFe layer that was used for the existing perpendicular anisotropy multilayer. Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure are intended to provide or will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a multi-stacked structure of CoFeSiB/Pt perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer formed according to the present disclosure. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer of FIG. 1 formed according to one embodiment of the present disclosure can be expressed as Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt (t1)/CoFeSiB (t2)]\u00d7n/Ta 50 in consideration of respective thicknesses, where thickness unit is angstrom. Herein, n denotes the number (i.e., the number of repetition times) of Pt (t1)/CoFeSiB (t2) layers, and t1 and t2 denotes thicknesses of Pt and CoFeSiB, respectively. Further, Si denotes the substrate, and SiO2 layer of which a thickness is considered to be insignificant is an oxide layer formed on the substrate. Here, the CoFeSiB has a composition of Here, Co84.8Fe5.96Si6.24B3.04\u0098Co70.5Fe4.5Si15B10 (in atomic percent) where t1, t2 and n are variables that can be variously changed. A direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method is used for depositing the multilayer of the present disclosure, where base pressure is less than 5\u00d710\u22128 Torr. The thickness of the layer is controlled through deposition time. The Pt and CoFeSiB layers are repetitively deposited to thereby form a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in virtue of surface anisotropy at an interface. According to measurement results of magnetic properties, the coercivity is about 20 Oe, the saturation magnetization is about 170 emu/cm3, and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is about 5\u00d7105 erg/cm3\u00985\u00d7106 erg/cm3, in the layer structure of Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d74/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom). Here, it is preferable that the number of repetition times be 3 or 4. As the number of repetition times increases, the coercivity also increases, which is not preferable. FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating the comparison of magnetic properties between an existing Co/Pt multilayer and the CoFeSiB/Pt multilayer formed according to the present disclosure. More specifically, FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating the comparison results of magnetic properties between the existing [Co/Pt] multilayer and the inventive [CoFeSiB/Pt] multilayer, in which they have the same structure and layer thickness. That is, the layer structure is Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB or Co 3]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom), and the magnetic property is measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). According to the results, the [CoFeSiB/Pt] multilayer of the present disclosure has one-tenth the coercivity and one-third the saturation magnetization of the existing [Co/Pt] multilayer. Thus, when the [CoFeSiB/Pt] multilayer of the present disclosure is applied to a free layer of pMTJ, it shows good switching characteristic. FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of Pt thickness (t) in the layer structure of Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt (t)/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom). Referring to FIG. 3, it can be understood that the coercivity and the saturation magnetization are varied with the variation of the Pt thickness (t1) in the layer structure of Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt (t)/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom). That is, it can be understood that the dipole-interaction between magnetic layers decreases with the increase of the Pt thickness, and particularly, the coercivity is abruptly reduced if the Pt thickness exceeds to 12. In addition, it can be also understood that the saturation magnetization decreases as the Pt thickness increases. It is preferable that the coercivity be less than 20 Oe in order that the multilayer may be used for a perpendicular magnetic tunneling junction (pMTJ). FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of number of repetition times (n) in the layer structure of Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB 3]\u00d7n/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom). Predictably, as the number of repetition times increases, it is understood that the coercivity increases and the saturation magnetization increases to a predetermined degree and then becomes constant after a predetermined value. Since the coercivity should be less than 20 Oe in order that the multilayer may be used for the pMTJ, it is preferable that the number of repetition times be 3 or 4. FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating variations of coercivity and saturation magnetization of the multilayer depending on the variation of CoFeSiB thickness (x) in Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB (x)]\u00d75/Ta 50 (thickness unit: Angstrom) formed according to the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 5, it is understood that the coercivity and the saturation magnetization are varied with the variation of CoFeSiB thickness (t2) in the Si/SiO2/Ta 50/Pt 4/[Pt 8/CoFeSiB t2]\u00d75/Ta 50. When the thickness of the CoFeSiB layer is 6 \u212b or smaller, the coercivity increases because the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy increases with the increase of thickness. However, when the thickness of the CoFeSiB layer is greater than 6 \u212b, the coercivity of the perpendicular component decreases because a bulk anisotropy increases and the horizontal magnetic component increases correspondingly. In case of the saturation magnetization, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy increases as the thickness of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy layer increases on condition that the thickness of the CoFeSiB layer is 6 \u212b or smaller. However, it can be understood that the saturation magnetization does not increase any more when the thickness is greater than a predetermined value. It is preferable that the coercivity be less than 20 Oe in order that the multilayer may be used for the pMTJ. Thus, it is understood that the CoFeSiB layer has the thickness of 3 \u212b or smaller in case that Pt has a thickness of 8 \u212b. According to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide a [Co84.8Fe5.96Si6.24B3.04/Pt]\u00d7n magnetic anisotropy multilayer having low coercivity, high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low saturation magnetization which is similar to remanent magnetization. Accordingly, it is also possible to form a highly integrated magnetic memory. Here, Co84.8Fe5.96Si6.24B3.04\u0098Co70.5Fe4.5Si15B10 can be used for the present disclosure. While the disclosure has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.",

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to oilfield operations, and more particularly, to methods and systems for determining anisotropy, dip, and azimuth from image data. When performing oilfield operations it is important to understand the structure and properties of the formation surrounding the well. The geological properties of the formation are important throughout the development of a well. For example, the geological properties of the formation can be used to determine if the formation contains hydrocarbons, determine the producibility of the hydrocarbons in the formation, and optimize production from the well. Wireline logging and/or logging-while-drilling (LWD) or measurement-while-drilling (MWD) (collectively \u0093logs\u0094) are commonly used to obtain measurements that shed light on the geological properties of a formation. Accordingly, one or more logging tools may be lowered into the borehole and used to obtain measurements as the tools traverse the borehole. These measurements may then be used to estimate a number of desired formation properties. One popular logging method utilizes nuclear magnetic resonance (\u0093NMR\u0094) measurements. The NMR measurements are based on the fact that when an assembly of magnetic moments, such as those of hydrogen nuclei, are exposed to a static magnetic field, they tend to align along the direction of the magnetic field, resulting in bulk magnetization. Accordingly, the magnetic properties of the nuclei may be used to obtain information about formation properties. Because of its non-destructive character, NMR logging has become one of the common methods for formation evaluation. NMR logging devices may be used independent of the drilling apparatus (i.e. in wireline logging) or in conjunction with the drilling apparatus (i.e. LWD/MWD) to obtain measurements while drilling is taking place. One of the applications of NMR and other logging techniques is the analysis of certain properties of the geological formation. Such properties may include, for example, permeability, porosity, resistivity, diffusivity, or viscosity. Anisotropic analysis of properties is particularly useful in reservoir engineering where data or logs obtained through multiple measurements at different locations may be combined in order to characterize each flow interval of the geological area by a single anisotropy, such as permeability anisotropy. The process of combining the data obtained through multiple measurements and multiple locations is referred to as \u0093up-scaling\u0094. Because the measurement data are typically taken at various scales and use different sample sizes, up-scaling the data can be difficult. Typically, the measurement data is processed by visual inspection and/or correlation. For instance, a single anisotropy, such as permeability anisotropy obtained for a flow interval, may be used to predict the producibility of the well. It is often necessary to perform well testing before such performance predictions can be made. However, the performance of well testing has become undesirable due to the high economic and environmental costs associated with it. Additionally it is desirable to obtain dip information for a geological formation. The sedimentary portion of the earth's surface is made up of successive layers or beds which do not typically have a constant thickness. These layers often exhibit a certain dip, e.g., an inclination with respect to a horizontal plane. The dip angle is the angle between the vertical direction and a line perpendicular to the bedding plane. The relative borehole dip is the angle between the borehole and a line perpendicular to the bedding planes. The dip of formation layers in a formation penetrated by a borehole may convey important information in petroleum prospecting. For example, such information may be useful for evaluating the chances of obtaining hydrocarbons from a borehole, for establishing the nature of adjacent geological structures and for choosing the location of new boreholes. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop an up-scaling method which honors the petrophysical spatial relationships of the data and can be used to combine different types of data including core data, wireline logs, wireline tester data and well testing to obtain image data anisotropy and the dip angle of the anisotropy. The azimuth angle is associated with the dipping plane and is the angle formed by the plane defining the anisotropy with respect to the north axis of the earth. Relative azimuth is the angle formed by the anisotropy plane and its intersection to the borehole.

While embodiments of this disclosure have been depicted and described and are defined by reference to example embodiments of the disclosure, such references do not imply a limitation on the disclosure, and no such limitation is to be inferred. The subject matter disclosed is capable of considerable modification, alteration, and equivalents in form and function, as will occur to those skilled in the pertinent art and having the benefit of this disclosure. The depicted and described embodiments of this disclosure are examples only, and not exhaustive of the scope of the disclosure. DESCRIPTION The present invention relates generally to oilfield operations, and more particularly, to methods and systems for determining anisotropy, dip, and azimuth from image data. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an array of measurements is first obtained along a borehole using traditional logging tools. Using a portion of this array positioned near a depth location, an up-scaling method is used to determine the anisotropy with respect to the plane. The up-scaling methods honor the petrophysical spatial relationships of data and determine the image data anisotropy. Anisotropy is a result of thin laminations that may be virtually undetectable using normal logs but may be well within the scale of image logs. These thin laminations may be oriented to anisotropy and the bedding plane. Up scaling methods may determine the anisotropy tensor even when this may not be apparent using pattern matching and visual inspection of the data. FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of steps of an up-scaling method in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Accordingly, at step 102, a depth point along the well bore is selected. Next, at step 104, a set of data points that is centered around the selected depth point is identified from the array of measurements. In one embodiment, the set of data points selected for a depth point may be the set of data points that are 1-5 ft. away from the depth point. FIG. 2 depicts an array of measurements along the borehole axis (z) with the dipping plane intersecting the borehole. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, the array of measurements may represent any desirable properties of the formation. In one embodiment, the array of measurement data may be an array of resistivity measurements obtained along the path of a well bore as shown in FIG. 2. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the anisotropy, dip and azimuth for the formation may be determined as follows. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, any number of data points may be used in the following steps. Moreover, the data points need not be symmetrically distributed around the borehole axis (z) and may be randomly distributed. Returning to FIG. 1, at step 106, an arbitrary plane oriented with respect to the borehole at the particular depth point is selected. The equation of the arbitrary plane 202 which passes through the origin as shown in FIG. 2, and is centered about an array of data points is as follows: x tan(\u03b8a)\u2212y+z tan(\u03b8d)=0 where \u03b8d is the relative dip angle with respect to the borehole axis (z) and \u03b8a is the azimuth angle with respect to the x-axis. In some instances, the plane may not intersect the actually measured points. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, when the plane does not intersect the actually measured points, two or more adjacent image data points can be interpolated to determine a value which the plane intersects. In one exemplary embodiment two adjacent data points may be used and a linear interpolation may be utilized. If more than two adjacent data points are used then other interpolation methods, such as, for example, bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation in two dimensions, and trilinear interpolation in three dimensions may be utilized. Such methods of interpolation are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and will therefore not be discussed in detail herein. Turning now to FIG. 3, consider a series of intersecting planes 302 that are offset from the assumed dipping plane. The number of planes and offset distance is arbitrary but should be symmetrical to the central location of all the data points considered as shown in FIG. 2. In one exemplary embodiment, the offset of the planes 302 may be roughly equal to the point spacing and is sufficient to intersect most of the data. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, FIGS. 2 and 3 may be visualized as shown in FIG. 4 where the cylinder of the wellbore is unwrapped and the data is presented in two dimensions. The sine curves in FIG. 4 are the intersecting planes where the horizontal axis is the angular displacement of the well bore oriented with the earth's axis (\u0093north-south\u0094) or high-side of the well bore depending on well bore orientation and the vertical axis is depth along the well bore. The interpolation can be done at regular intervals using two or more adjacent data points as described earlier. FIG. 4 further depicts how the dimensions of the sine curve can be used to determine the orientation of the planes' azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d. The azimuth angle \u03b8a is oriented to the lowest apex of the sine curve and the dip angle \u03b8d is determined from the amplitude of the sine curve as follows. \u03b8 a = \u03b8 m i n + arc cos ( \uf603 z m i n A \uf604 ) \u03b8 d = arc tan ( A r w ) With the assumed azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d, the anisotropy may be determined at step 108 as follows. First, the average resistivity for all the interpolated values of Re intersecting the planes which is the plane resistivity Rplane(m) is calculated as follows, where m is the number of data points intersecting the planes. R plane ( j ) = 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) Rplane(j) represents the average for each plane j containing m points. Further, the average Re for all n planes is the vertical resistivity and is obtained as follows: R v = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n R plane ( j ) = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) ) Next, the horizontal resistivity (Rh) is determined from harmonic average as: R h _ = n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 R plane ( j ) _ ) = n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) _ ) Accordingly, for an assumed azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d, the up-scaled resistivity anisotropy may be determined at step 108 as: \u03b3 r = Rv Rh Because resistivity anisotropy is typically greater than one, it is useful to consider its inverse for imaging data. This normalizes that data from 1 to 0 and may be referred to as the resistivity anisotropy coefficient (\u03bbr) which may be determined as: \u03bb r = 1 \u03b3 r = R h _ R v _ In other forms of anisotropy such as permeability anisotropy the vertical permeability is normally lower than the horizontal permeability and therefore varies between 0 and 1. Therefore, in accordance with the methods and systems disclosed herein, the anisotropy coefficient of any rock property is defined as being between 0 and 1 which is either the vertical property divided by the horizontal property or the horizontal property divided by the vertical property. Specifically, the anisotropy coefficient of a rock property may be defined as the numerical average divided by the harmonic average of the rock property. As would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, in one embodiment, at step 108, the value of the anisotropy as well as the value of the azimuth angle \u03b8a and the dip angle \u03b8d corresponding to the calculated anisotropy for the particular depth point may be stored. Returning now to FIG. 1, once anisotropy with respect to a first arbitrary plane is determined, the plane is repositioned with respect to dip and/or azimuth and the anisotropy is determined and compared to the previous anisotropy measurement. In order to reposition the plane, the azimuth angle \u03b8a may be varied between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 and/or dip angle \u03b8d may be varied between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The process is repeated until a minimum anisotropy coefficient is determined at each position along the well bore or a selected interval within the well bore. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, at step 110 it is determined if the anisotropy at the selected depth point has been calculated for the different values of the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 and/or dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. If not, at step 112 the arbitrary plane is repositioned at the selected depth point by varying the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 and/or dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The anisotropy for the new orientation of the arbitrary plane is determined at step 108. Steps 108, 110, and 112 are repeated until the anisotropy is determined for the different values of the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 and/or dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. As shown in FIG. 1, the process then proceeds to step 114 where the minimum anisotropy coefficient for the particular depth point is selected. In one embodiment, all the anisotropy values stored at step 108 may be compared to determine the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point. Once the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point is identified, the orientation of the arbitrary plane corresponding to that minimum anisotropy coefficient value may also be identified based on the corresponding azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d. The minimum anisotropy coefficient and its corresponding azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d for the particular depth point may then be provided as an output. This minimum value of anisotropy along with the dip and azimuth of the plane now defines the anisotropy tensor for this depth point. At step 116 it is determined if the selected depth point is the last depth point that is to be considered in the borehole. If so, the process will terminate at step 118. If the selected depth point is not the last depth point that is to be considered, the process will proceed to step 120. The selected depth point may then be incremented at step 120 and the process may be repeated for the entire array of measurements along the borehole or a selected portion thereof. In one embodiment, the process may only be repeated for a certain portion of the array of measurements as desired. In one exemplary embodiment, the depth may be incremented by 1 to 5 feet at step 120. Once calculations are completed for the different depth points, the resulting anisotropy, dip and azimuth may be plotted with their respective depth positions to provide geological information for the particular formation. Turning now to FIG. 5, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the azimuth angle \u03b8a may be determined first followed by the dip angle \u03b8d. Accordingly, at step 402, a depth point along the well bore is selected. Next, at step 404, a set of data points that is centered around the selected depth point is identified from the array of measurements. In one embodiment, the set of data points selected for a depth point may be the set of data points that are 1-5 ft. away from the depth point. At step 406, an arbitrary plane oriented with respect to the borehole at the particular depth point is selected. FIG. 6 depicts a series of lines where each plane is offset by a regular spacing parallel to the assumed azimuth angle \u03b8a. A cross section of the well bore may contain an array of circular data points 502. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, the data points do not have to be on the cross section and can be interpolated from adjacent points. The anisotropy may then be determined by taking the simple numerical average of all of the points for Rv and then the harmonic average for the averages of each line containing the interpolated points. Specifically, the average for each line j, containing m points, may be obtained as: R line ( j ) = 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) The average Re for all n lines may then be determined as the vertical resistivity, Rv: R v = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n R line ( j ) _ = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) ) Next, the horizontal resistivity (Rv) may be determined from the harmonic average of the lines: R h _ = n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 R line ( j ) _ ) = n \u2211 j = 1 n ( 1 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m ( R ( i , j ) ) _ ) Accordingly, for an assumed azimuth angle \u03b8a and dip angle \u03b8d the up-scaled resistivity anisotropy coefficient may be determined at step 408 as: \u03bb r = 1 \u03b3 r = R h _ R v _ As would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, in one embodiment, at step 408, the value of the anisotropy as well as the value of the azimuth angle \u03b8a corresponding to the calculated anisotropy for the particular depth point may be stored. Returning now to FIG. 5, once anisotropy with respect to a first arbitrary plane is determined, the plane is repositioned with respect to azimuth and the anisotropy is determined and compared to the previous anisotropy measurement. The dip angle \u03b8d remains unchanged at this step. In order to reposition the plane, the azimuth angle \u03b8a may be varied between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 The process is repeated until a minimum anisotropy coefficient is determined at each position along the well bore or a selected interval within the well bore. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 5, at step 410 it is determined if the anisotropy at the selected depth point has been calculated for the different values of the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, while dip angle \u03b8d remains substantially constant. If not, at step 412 the arbitrary plane is repositioned at the selected depth point by varying the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. The anisotropy for the new orientation of the arbitrary plane is determined at step 408. Steps 408, 410, and 412 are repeated until the anisotropy is determined for the different values of the azimuth angle \u03b8a between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. As shown in FIG. 5, the process then proceeds to step 414 where the minimum anisotropy coefficient for the particular depth point is selected. In one embodiment, all the anisotropy values stored at step 408 may be compared to determine the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point. Once the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point is identified, the orientation of the arbitrary plane corresponding to that minimum anisotropy coefficient value may also be identified based on the corresponding azimuth angle \u03b8a. The minimum anisotropy coefficient and its corresponding azimuth angle \u03b8a for the particular depth point may then be provided as an output at step 414. At step 416 it is determined if the selected depth point is the last depth point that is to be considered in the borehole. If so, the azimuth angle \u03b8a of the plane at each depth point corresponding to the minimum anisotropy coefficient may be used at step 418 to determine an average azimuth angle \u03b8a-avg. for the particular well bore interval. If the selected depth point is not the last depth point that is to be considered, the process will proceed to step 420. The selected depth point may then be incremented at step 420 and the process may be repeated for the entire array of measurements along the borehole or a selected portion thereof. In one embodiment, the process may only be repeated for a certain portion of the array of measurements as desired. In one exemplary embodiment, the depth may be incremented by 1 to 5 feet at step 420. Once the average azimuth angle \u03b8a-avg. for the particular interval is determined, the \u03b8a-avg. may be used as the assumed azimuth angle for the particular interval and used to determine the dip for this interval. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 7, at step 602, a depth point along the well bore is selected. Next, at step 604, a set of data points that is centered around the selected depth point is identified from the array of measurements. In one embodiment, the set of data points selected for a depth point may be the set of data points that are 1-5 ft. away from the depth point. At step 606, an arbitrary plane oriented with respect to the borehole at the particular depth point is selected having the average azimuth angle \u03b8a-avg. and a dip angle \u03b8d. As discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 6, for the assumed azimuth angle \u03b8a-avg. and dip angle \u03b8d the up-scaled resistivity anisotropy may then be determined at step 608. As would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, in one embodiment, at step 608, the value of the anisotropy as well as the value of the dip angle \u03b8d corresponding to the calculated anisotropy for the particular depth point may be stored. Once anisotropy with respect to a first arbitrary plane is determined, the plane is repositioned with respect to dip and the anisotropy is determined and compared to the previous anisotropy measurement. In order to reposition the plane, the dip angle \u03b8d may be varied between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The process is repeated until a minimum anisotropy coefficient is determined at each position along the well bore or a selected interval within the well bore. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 7, at step 610 it is determined if the anisotropy at the selected depth point has been calculated for the different values of the dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The value of the azimuth angle remains substantially constant as \u03b8a-avg. If not, at step 612 the arbitrary plane is repositioned at the selected depth point by varying the dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The anisotropy for the new orientation of the arbitrary plane is determined at step 608. Steps 608, 610, and 612 are repeated until the anisotropy is determined for the different values of the dip angle \u03b8d between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. As shown in FIG. 7, the process then proceeds to step 614 where the minimum anisotropy coefficient for the particular depth point is selected. In one embodiment, all the anisotropy values stored at step 608 may be compared to determine the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point. Once the minimum anisotropy coefficient at the particular depth point is identified, the orientation of the arbitrary plane corresponding to that minimum anisotropy coefficient value may also be identified based on the corresponding dip angle \u03b8d. The minimum anisotropy coefficient and its corresponding dip angle \u03b8d for the particular depth point may then be provided as an output. At step 616 it is determined if the selected depth point is the last depth point that is to be considered in the borehole. If so, the process terminates at step 618. If the selected depth point is not the last depth point that is to be considered, the process will proceed to step 620. The selected depth point may then be incremented at step 620 and the process may be repeated for the entire array of measurements along the borehole or a selected portion thereof. In one embodiment, the process may only be repeated for a certain portion of the array of measurements as desired. In one exemplary embodiment, the depth may be incremented by 1 to 5 feet at step 620. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, determining an average azimuth angle \u03b8a-avg. may speed up the dip determination as only dip angle is determined at each step of the process of FIG. 7.

No. 13/609,780, filing date Sep. 11, 2012; both assigned to a common assignee and herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to a magnetic device that utilizes thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and a method for making the same, and in particular, to decreasing the Ho field from a reference layer on a free layer while increasing Hc and thermal stability in the resulting multilayer magnetic stack with a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer having enhanced RKKY coupling. BACKGROUND Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), based on the integration of silicon CMOS with MTJ technology, is a major emerging technology that is highly competitive with existing semiconductor memories such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash. Similarly, spin-transfer (spin torque or STT) magnetization switching described by C. Slonczewski in \u0093Current driven excitation of magnetic multilayers\u0094, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. V 159, L1-L7 (1996), has recently stimulated considerable interest due to its potential application for spintronic devices such as STT-MRAM on a gigabit scale. J-G. Zhu et al. has described another spintronic device called a spin transfer oscillator (STO) in \u0093Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording\u0094, IEEE Trans. on Magnetics, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp. 125-131 (2008) where a spin transfer momentum effect is relied upon to enable recording at a head field significantly below the medium coercivity in a perpendicular recording geometry. The STO comprises a stack including a spin injection layer (SIL) with PMA character, an oscillating field generation layer (FGL) with in-plane anisotropy, and a spacer between the SIL and FGL. Both MRAM and STT-MRAM may have a MTJ element, based on a tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect wherein a stack of layers has a configuration in which two ferromagnetic layers typically referred to as a reference layer and free layer are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer. The MTJ element is typically formed between a bottom electrode such as a first conductive line and a top electrode which is a second conductive line at locations where the top electrode crosses over the bottom electrode in a MRAM device. In another aspect, a MTJ element in a read head sensor may be based on a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect that relates to a spin valve structure where a reference layer and free layer are separated by a metal spacer. In sensor structures, the MTJ is, formed between two shields and there is a hard bias layer adjacent to the MTJ element to provide longitudinal biasing for stabilizing the free layer magnetization. In a MTJ within a MRAM or STT-MRAM, a reference layer will usually exert a stray magnetic field upon the free layer that tends to favor either the P or AP state. The stray \u0093offset\u0094 field (Ho) has a form similar to a non-uniform electric \u0093fringing\u0094 field at the edges of a parallel plate capacitor. As depicted in FIG. 1, the stray field (Ho) 4 from reference layer 1 impinges on the free layer 3. Note that a dielectric spacer 2 such as a tunnel barrier layer separates the free layer and reference layer. When reference layer 1 is a composite, the net stray field 4 will be the sum of fringing fields from several similar layers in the reference layer stack with the possible addition of a uniform effective \u0093interlayer\u0094 coupling field. The free layer is subject to random thermal agitation and the stray field will create a disparity in the thermal stability of the two states, with either the P or AP state rendered more thermally stable. This asymmetry is undesirable since for a given free layer coercivity (Hc), Ho should be zero for optimum stability. Generally, Ho=0 is difficult to achieve in practice, and as a rule, Ho<15% of Hc is a reasonable target in actual devices. Materials with PMA are of particular importance for magnetic and magnetic-optic recording applications. Spintronic devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have an advantage over MRAM devices based on in-plane anisotropy in that they can satisfy the thermal stability requirement and have a low switching current density but also have no limit of cell aspect ratio. As a result, spin valve structures based on PMA are capable of scaling for higher packing density which is one of the key challenges for future MRAM applications and spintronic devices. When the size of a memory cell is reduced, much larger magnetic anisotropy is required because the thermal stability factor is proportional to the volume of the memory cell. Generally, PMA materials have magnetic anisotropy larger than that of conventional in-plane soft magnetic materials which utilize shape anisotropy. Thus, magnetic devices with PMA are advantageous for achieving low switching current and high thermal stability. For spin torque applications, a free layer with high Hc and low offset field (Ho) is required. In addition, the free layer preferably has a high energy barrier Eb=KuV/KBT where Ku is the magnetic anisotropy, V is the switching magnetic volume, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the measurement temperature. A SAF free layer has been employed with a coupling layer (spacer) formed between two ferromagnetic layers (FL1 and FL2) having PMA in opposite directions in order to reduce coupling between a free layer and reference layer in a MTJ stack. Several PMA material systems for FL1 and FL2 include various ordered (i.e. L10) alloys, unordered alloys, and laminates represented by (Pt/Fe)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Ni/Co)n, and the like, where n is the lamination number. Magnetization direction for FL1 and FL2 is anti-parallel due to the RKKY coupling through a metal spacer. There is a big challenge to increase the RKKY (anti-ferromagnetic) coupling strength to enhance magnetic stability and thermal stability of the free layer to be compatible with semiconductor processes that reach as high as 400\u00b0 C. or higher. A higher annealing temperature of >350\u00b0 C. is also useful in achieving an enhanced TMR ratio. None of existing technology is known to provide low Ho with high Hc and a Kb value approaching 70 for thermal stability in a PMA layer that will withstand high temperature processing up to 400\u00b0 C. or greater which is required in fabrication methods. Therefore, a low cost multilayer stack with high PMA, high Hc, low Ho, and improved thermal stability is needed to enable PMA materials to be more widely accepted in a variety of magnetic device applications. SUMMARY One objective of the present disclosure is to provide a SAF free layer with PMA in MTJ stack in a magnetic device that has an Eb value greater than at least 70 and a low offset field (Ho) less than 100 Oe that is suitable for spintronic applications such as spin-torque MRAM (STT-MRAM), and microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR). A second objective of the present disclosure is to provide a MTJ element with a SAF free layer having a magnetic coercivity (Hc) substantially greater than the Ho field to enable improved stability of the P or AP magnetic state in the free layer. According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, these objectives are achieved by sequentially forming a reference layer, tunnel barrier layer, SAF free layer, and capping layer on a substrate wherein the SAF free layer has a FL1/dusting layer 1/coupling layer/dusting layer 2/FL2 configuration in which the FL1 and FL2 ferromagnetic layers have PMA character, the coupling layer is Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Mo, or other metals that induce RKKY or antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers, and the DL1, DL2 dusting layers enhance the RKKY coupling. The substrate may be a seed layer that is one or more of NiCr, NiFeCr, Mg, Ta, TaN, Ti, Ru, or other materials that maintain or enhance PMA in an overlying reference layer. In one aspect, FL1 and FL2 are laminates such as (Ni/Co)n, (Pt/Co)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Co/Ru)n, and the like where n is the lamination number which is from 1 to 10, and preferably 1 to 4. However, Co may be replaced by a Co-rich alloy such as CoFe or CoFeB wherein Co content is greater than that of Fe or B, and Ni may be replaced by a Ni rich alloy such as NiFe or NiFeB. In an alternative embodiment, FL1 and FL2 are L10 ordered alloys including FePt, CoPt, and FePd. In yet another embodiment, FL1 and FL2 may be rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) films such as TbFeCo, GdFeCo, and the like. When a high MR ratio is preferred, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be comprised of CoFeB or CoNiFeB. A key feature is the dusting layer formed on top and bottom surfaces of the middle spacer that enhances antiferromagnetic coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers. The dusting layer has a thickness between 1 and 50 Angstroms, and preferably from 1 to 10 Angstroms, and is made of Co, Fe, Ni, NiFe, or a CoxFeyNiz alloy wherein x, y, and z are the atomic % of Co, Fe, and Ni, respectively. The dusting layers may be deposited at room temperature or at an elevated temperature up to 400\u00b0 C. Subsequently, annealing up to 400\u00b0 C. or higher, and preferably 350\u00b0 C., may be employed to further improve PMA properties and thereby increase Hc and Hk in the free layer. In a first embodiment that represents a bottom spin valve configuration, a seed layer, reference layer, tunnel barrier layer, SAF free layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The reference layer may be a composite with a SAF configuration represented by AP2/coupling layer/AP1 where AP1 and AP2 are antiparallel coupled ferromagnetic layers, or by RL1/DL5/coupling layer/DL6/RL2 configuration wherein RL1 and RL2 are first and second reference layers with PMA that have a laminated structure, an L10 ordered composition, or are made of a RE-TM film as described previously, and DL5 and DL6 are dusting layers formed on top and bottom surfaces of a coupling layer. The SAF free layer preferably has the FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 structure described previously. In a STO embodiment, the SAF reference layer serves as the field generation layer (FGL) in a MAMR structure while the SAF free layer functions as a spin injection layer (SIL). The present disclosure also encompasses an embodiment where the MTJ element has a top spin valve configuration in a STT-MRAM scheme represented by seed layer/SAF free layer/tunnel barrier/reference layer/capping layer wherein the SAF free layer has a FL1/DL2/coupling layer/DL1/FL2 design with the FL1 layer contacting the seed layer. The reference layer may have a SAF configuration that is represented by RL1/DL5/coupling layer/DL6/RL2 where RL1 and RL2 are selected from the same PMA materials as FL1 and FL2, and DL5 and DL6 are selected from the same dusting layer materials as DL1 and DL2. The coupling layer is a non-magnetic material such as Ru or Mo, for example. According to a third embodiment, there may be a transitional layer made of CoFeB/Co or the like inserted between the SAF FL2 layer and tunnel barrier layer in a top spin valve configuration. In a bottom spin valve configuration with a SAF reference layer having PMA, the transitional layer may be inserted between the RL2 layer and the tunnel barrier layer. In all embodiments, we observe that a substantial coercivity (Hc) and RKKY exchange coupling strength is maintained even after annealing at 400\u00b0 C. for one hour. A dual SAF free layer structure may be used to further improve Hc and thermal stability and has a FL1/DL1/coupling layer1/DL2/FL2/DL3/coupling layer 2/DL4/FL3 configuration where the FL1 layer contacts a tunnel barrier layer and the FL3 layer interfaces with a capping layer in a bottom spin valve MTJ stack. In yet another embodiment, the coupling layer thickness in a FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 scheme may be modified to yield a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) free layer that is an alternative to a single free layer because of higher magnetic volume in the SyF structure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure is a multilayer stack with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and enhanced RKKY coupling that may be employed as a reference layer, free layer, or dipole layer in magnetic devices such as MRAM and STT-MRAM, in spintronic devices such as MAMR, in various designs of PMA spin valves including MTJ elements, and in PMA magnetic media used in magnetic sensors and data storage. Although the exemplary embodiments depict a bottom spin valve or a top spin valve structure, the present disclosure also applies to dual spin valve designs as appreciated by those skilled in the art. A non-magnetic spacer that serves as an antiferromagnetic coupling layer in SAF structures described herein is hereafter mentioned simply as \u0093coupling layer\u0094 to avoid confusion with the non-magnetic spacer formed between the free layer and reference layer in the MTJ stacks of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 2, the most basic representation of a synthetic anti-ferromagnetic (SAF) layer of the present disclosure is depicted as a SAF free layer 30 with a FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration that is formed on a substrate such as a non-magnetic layer (spacer) 29 which may be a tunnel barrier layer that is comprised of a dielectric material including one or more of MgO, AlOx, TiOx, ZnO, or other metal oxides or metal nitrides in a tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) scheme, for example. Alternatively, the non-magnetic spacer may be comprised of Cu or another high conductivity metal or metal alloy in a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) embodiment. The present disclosure also anticipates a GMR embodiment wherein spacer 29 has a current confining path (CCP) structure in which a dielectric layer with metal paths therein is sandwiched between two metal layers (i.e. Cu) as appreciated by those skilled in the art. The planes of the layers illustrated in all embodiments are in a (x, y) plane and each layer has a thickness in the z-axis direction. SAF free layer 30 is a composite with a lower ferromagnetic layer (FL 1 ) 31 and an uppermost ferromagnetic layer (FL2) 35, and each of FL1 and FL2 has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) that may be intrinsic or induced through an interface with an oxide layer, for example. In a preferred embodiment, there is a coupling layer 33 that induces RKKY coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers, and there are first and second dusting layers DL1 32, DL2 34, respectively, that enhance the aforementioned RKKY coupling. Thus, FL1 layer 31 has a magnetization 52 aligned in a (+) z-axis direction and FL2 layer 35 has a magnetization 51 aligned in an opposite direction to that of FL1. In an alternative magnetic state, the directions of magnetizations 51, 52 are reversed with respect to the arrows shown in FIG. 2. Layers 31-35 may be sequentially sputter deposited on the non-magnetic layer 29. Thus, DL1 adjoins a top surface of FL1 31 and interfaces with a bottom surface of coupling layer 33 while DL2 interfaces with a top surface of the coupling layer and adjoins a bottom surface of FL2 35. FL1 and FL2 layers 31, 35 may be a laminated structure such as (Co/Ni)n, (Co/Pd)n, (Co/Pt)n, (Co/Ru)n, or other laminated stacks exhibiting intrinsic PMA where n is between 1 and 10, and preferably from 1 to 4. It should be understood that the aforementioned laminated stacks may also be represented by (Ni/Co)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Pt/Co)n, and (Ru/Co)n, respectively, depending on which of the metal layers is deposited first. The present disclosure also anticipates that one or more of the laminated layers may be a Co-based alloy such as CoFe or CoFeB as a replacement for Co, and a Ni-based alloy such as NiCo, NiFe, or NiFeB may be a replacement for Ni. Preferably, the Co-based alloy is Co rich wherein the Co content is >50 atomic %, and the Ni-based alloy is Ni rich wherein the Ni content is >50 atomic %. Thus, (CoFe/Ni)n, (CoFeB/Ni)n, (Co/NiFe)n, (Co/NiFeB)n, and (NiCo/Co)n are alternatives for FL1 and FL2 layers. Typically, the Co or Co alloy layer in the laminates has a thickness between 0.5 and 5 Angstroms while the Pd, Pt, Ni, or Ni alloy layer has a thickness from 2 to 10 Angstroms. Note that FL1 and FL2 layers may have the same composition or may be made of different laminated stacks. Furthermore, the number of laminations in the FL1 layer 31 may differ from the number of laminations in the FL2 layer 35. Typically, as the number \u0093n\u0094 of laminations increases, PMA within the laminated layer increases. However, the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio for a laminated layer such as (Co/Ni)n is generally less than observed for a CoFe or CoFeB layer. In another embodiment, one or both of FL1 layer 31 and FL2 layer 35 are comprised of L10 ordered alloys such as FePt, CoPt, FePd, NiPt, FeNi, FeCu, MnAl, MnPt, MnPd, CuAu, and the like that have PMA character. In this case, FL1 and FL2 layers each have a thickness from 15 to 150 Angstroms. In yet another embodiment, FL1 and FL2 layers may be made of rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) films including TbFeCo, GdFeCo, and the like that exhibit PMA. The present disclosure also anticipates that one of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be one of the aforementioned laminates, L10 alloy, or a RE-TM alloy while the other of the FL1 or FL2 layers is another of the laminates, L10 alloy, or a RE-TM alloy. In yet another embodiment, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers is made of an alloy such as CoFeB or CoNiFeB that has PMA because interfacial perpendicular anisotropy is established as a result of an interface with an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride layer. For instance, when FL1 31 is CoFeB or CoNiFeB and interfaces with a non-magnetic spacer 29 that is a tunnel barrier comprised of MgO or the like, then PMA is generated in a FL1 layer having a thickness from 5 to 20 Angstroms. Likewise, when FL2 35 is CoFeB or CoNiFeB and interfaces with a capping layer (FIG. 3) made of an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride, then PMA is generated in a FL2 layer with a thickness from 5 to 20 Angstroms. The coupling layer 33 is one of Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Ir, Mo, or other metals capable of inducing RKKY coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers 21, 25. Ru is often selected as the coupling layer because a higher coupling strength is achieved with a FL1/DL1/Ru/DL2/FL2 configuration when DL1 and DL2 are Co dusting layers. However, we have found that other coupling layers such as Mo when used with a Fe dusting layer will generate a RKKY coupling strength equal to greater than that provided by a Ru coupling layer and Co dusting layers. According to the present disclosure, the thickness of the metal coupling layer is between 2 and 20 Angstroms with 4 or 9 Angstroms being preferred since either of these thicknesses will lead to the largest RKKY anti-parallel coupling strength in a FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration. Note that 13 Angstroms is another coupling layer thickness that produces significant anti-parallel coupling strength. As explained later, an intermediate coupling layer thickness of 6 Angstroms or a coupling layer thickness less than 3 Angstroms may be selected to establish a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) structure using the same stack of layers 31-35. D1 layer 32 and D2 layer 34 are referred to as dusting layers and have a thickness between 1 and 50 Angstroms, and preferably from 1 to 10 Angstroms. The dusting layers are made of Co, Fe, Ni, or an alloy thereof such as CoFeNi or NiFe. We have found that inserting a first dusting layer between coupling layer 33 and FL1 layer 31, and a second dusting layer between the coupling layer and FL2 layer 35 provides an advantage in substantially enhancing the RKKY coupling strength thereby improving thermal stability of SAF free layer 30. Furthermore, a subsequent anneal up to 400\u00b0 C., and preferably at about 350\u00b0 C., after all layers in the SAF free layer stack are deposited, may be employed to further improve PMA properties by increasing Hc and Hk. DL1 layer 32 and DL2 layer 34 may be sputter deposited at room temperature (RT) or at elevated temperatures up to 400\u00b0 C. or even higher. With dusting layer thicknesses greater than about 15 Angstroms, layers 31, 35 may have a canted magnetization angle where the magnetic moments 51, 52 are between 0 and 90 degrees with respect to the planes of the layers in the SAF free layer stack. In this case, a smaller PMA is achieved in the SAF free layer stack than with thinner DL1 and DL2 layers. The present disclosure also encompasses an embodiment wherein only one dusting layer 32 or 34 is employed in a SAF structure. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate there is a substantial benefit in terms of higher RKKY coupling and greater thermal stability when using both dusting layers rather than only one. Referring to FIG. 3, a second embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted and shows a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack wherein a seed layer 15, SAF reference layer 20, non-magnetic spacer 29, SAF free layer 30, and a capping layer 40 are sequentially formed on a substrate 10. The present disclosure also anticipates that an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer (not shown) may be inserted between the seed layer and SAF reference layer to pin the magnetization direction of an adjoining AP2 layer in a SAF reference layer that has an AP2/coupling/AP1 configuration. The substrate may be a bottom electrode in a STT-MRAM, a main pole in a STO, or a bottom shield in a TMR sensor, for example. A seed layer 15 is selected that is comprised of one or more of NiCr, NiFeCr, Ta, TaN, Mg, Ru or other metals or alloys to maintain or enhance PMA, Hc, and Hk in overlying magnetic layers. In one aspect, the reference layer has a SAF structure with an antiferromagnetic coupling layer 22 made of Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Ir, or Mo sandwiched between AP2 and AP1 ferromagnetic layers. Preferably, AP1 layer 23 that adjoins a bottom surface of the non-magnetic spacer (tunnel barrier) 29 has PMA that is aligned in a direction parallel or anti-parallel to magnetization 52 in FL1 layer 31. PMA in AP1 layer 23 may be induced through an interface with the tunnel barrier. In one aspect, the AP1 layer may be comprised of CoFeB or CoFeB/Co. The AP2 layer 21 may be comprised of CoFe or the like with an in-plane magnetization. The capping layer 40 formed on the SAF free layer 30 may be comprised of one or more non-magnetic metals including Ta, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Hf, Pt, Pd, W, Nb, Rh, Ru, Cu, Cr, Os, and Ir. Optionally, the capping layer is comprised of a dielectric material that is a metal oxide or an oxide of a metal alloy including MgTaOx, MgO, MgZrOx, SiOx, SrTiOx, BaTiOx, CaTiOx, LaAlOx, MnOx, VOx, Al2O3, TiOx, BOx, ZrOx, and HfOx. Preferably, capping layer 40 is made of MgTaOx wherein the Mg:Ta ratio is from about 2:1 to 1:1. Moreover, the capping layer may be comprised of a lamination of one or more of the aforementioned oxides. Referring to FIG. 4, a third embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated and retains the same features as the second embodiment except the AP2 layer 21 a and AP1 layer 23 a in the SAF reference layer 20 exhibit intrinsic PMA and may be comprised of the same laminated stack, L10 ordered alloy, or RE-TM film as previously described with respect to FL1 and FL2 layers 31, 35. Thus, the third embodiment has a bottom spin valve configuration wherein a seed layer, AP2 layer with PMA, coupling layer, AP1layer with PMA, non-magnetic spacer, SAF free layer, and capping layer are consecutively formed on a substrate. According to a fourth embodiment in FIG. 5, the MTJ stack of layers retains the same layers as in FIG. 4 except the reference layer, now designated as SAF reference layer 25, further includes an uppermost transition layer 24 between the AP1 layer 23 a and non-magnetic spacer 29. The transition layer may be comprised of CoNiFeB, CoFeB, CoFe, Co, or composites thereof such as CoFeB/Co. In a preferred embodiment, the transition layer is formed between a (111) AP1 layer with PMA and a (100) MgO tunnel barrier, and is sufficiently thin to preserve the PMA property of layer 23 a and yet thick enough to provide a high magnetoresistance (MR ratio). Thus, in a CoFeB/Co transitional layer 24, the CoFeB portion may be from 4 to 15 Angstroms thick, and preferably 6 Angstroms, while the Co layer portion is from 3 to 8 Angstroms, and preferably 4 Angstroms thick. Co may be used as the uppermost layer in the reference layer stack and the interface with the tunnel barrier layer since it is more resistant to oxidation than a CoFeB (or CoFe) layer. In other words, in a conventional MTJ, oxygen can migrate out of a MgO tunnel barrier layer into a reference layer thereby causing partial oxidation of CoFeB or the like, which leads to a degradation in the MR ratio. Referring to FIG. 6, a SAF free layer structure of the present disclosure may be incorporated in a MAMR embodiment wherein a spin torque oscillator (STO) structure is formed between two terminals. In the exemplary embodiment that depicts a portion of a perpendicular magnetic writer, the substrate 10 is a main pole layer and serves as a first terminal wherein magnetic flux 70 a is directed through an air bearing surface (ABS) 55-55 and into a magnetic medium (not shown). After writing one or more magnetic bits, flux 70 b returns to the write shield that is a second terminal 45. The STO structure has a first non-magnetic layer (NM1) such as seed layer 15 adjoining the first terminal 10, a second non-magnetic layer (NM2) that may be capping layer 40 adjoining the second terminal 45, and a third non-magnetic layer (NM3) such as spacer 29 formed between a spin injection layer (SIL) 20 and a field generation layer (FGL) 30 to give a NM1/SIL/NM3/FGL/NM2 configuration. The STO has a side 54 formed along the ABS, and the write head comprised of main pole 10, STO, and write shield 45 moves in a z-axis direction over a magnetic medium during a write process. The SAF reference layer 20 functions as a SIL also known in the art as a spin polarization (SP) layer that spin polarizes current passing through the STO stack in a current perpendicular to plane (CPP) direction and thereby applies a spin torque on the SAF free layer 30 which serves as the FGL and is also referred to as an oscillation layer. As a result, when a dc bias is applied across the STO stack by injecting direct current with a critical current density into the first terminal 10 or into the second terminal 45, then spin torque on the FGL induces magnetization in layers 31, 35 in SAF structure 30 to oscillate with a large angle oscillation thereby generating a rf field that assists the writing process to a magnetic bit in the magnetic medium. In an alternative embodiment, the roles of the SAF free layer and SAF reference, layer may be reversed with SAF layer 30 serving as a SIL and SAF layer 20 functioning as the FGL. It should be understood that SAF reference layer 20 may be substituted with another SAF reference layer described in alternative embodiments or by any reference layer with PMA. Referring to FIG. 7, a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted wherein the free layer has a dual SAF configuration. In this scheme, all the features of the fourth embodiment are retained. In addition, a third dusting layer DL3 41, second coupling layer 38, fourth dusting layer DL4 42, and third ferromagnetic layer FL3 39 are sequentially formed on a top surface of FL2 layer 35. The resulting dual SAF free layer structure 44 has a FL1/DL1/coupling layer 1/DL2/FL2/DL3/coupling layer 2/DL4/FL3 configuration. Note that FL3 layer 39 interfaces with a bottom surface of capping layer 40. The second coupling layer 38 induces RKKY coupling between the FL2 and FL3 layers and may be made of the same material as in the first coupling layer 33. DL3 and DL4 layers are selected from the same materials previously described with respect to the DL1 and DL2 layers and enhance RKKY coupling between the FL2 and FL3 layers. Furthermore, FL3 layer 39 has PMA and is preferably one of a laminated stack, L10 ordered alloy, or RE-TM film previously mentioned with regard to FL1 and FL2 layers 31, 35. Alternatively, the FL3 layer may be made of CoFeB or CoNiFeB. Moreover, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be CoFeB or CoNiFeB. It is believed that a dual SAF free layer design will further improve thermal stability and Hc for a SAF structure compared with the advantages achieved in previous embodiments for a single SAF free layer scheme. When a SAF free layer structure is employed as described in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the magnetic interaction between the SAF free layer and SAF reference layer is reduced and thereby minimizes the offset field (Ho) on the free layer after patterning the MTJ stack of layers. The Ku (anisotropy constant) for the free layer will impact the Eb (energy barrier) of the memory cell and it is believed that the insertion of two or more dusting layers will also increase the PMA Ku of the free layer thereby increasing Eb and enhancing the retention time of STT-MRAM designs. The lamination number \u0093n\u0094 in a SAF free layer 30 (or 37 or 44) is preferably minimized to between 1 and 4 in order to prevent Ku from becoming too high and requiring a substantially higher write current when switching the free layer. The present disclosure also anticipates a top spin valve design as depicted in FIG. 8 wherein SAF free layer 30, non-magnetic spacer 29, reference layer 26, and capping layer 40 are consecutively formed on seed layer 15. The resulting MTJ configuration with a single SAF free layer scheme is represented as seed layer/FL1 /DL1 /coupling layer/DL2/FL2/non-magnetic spacer/AP1/coupling layer/AP2/cap layer. Therefore, the same layers are employed as in the bottom spin valve embodiment shown in FIG. 4 except the order of deposition on substrate 10 is modified. In particular, the order of AP1 and AP2 layer deposition is changed such that the AP1 layer 23 a (or 23) contacts a top surface of the non-magnetic spacer and is deposited before the AP2 layer 21 a (or 21) in reference layer 26. Referring to FIG. 9, another top spin valve embodiment is illustrated and retains all of the features of the previous embodiment shown in FIG. 8 except where the SAF free layer structure is further comprised of an uppermost transition layer 24 such as CoFeB/Co as described in an earlier embodiment. As a result, SAF free layer 37 has a FL1/DL1/ coupling layer/DL2/FL2/transition layer configuration wherein the transition layer forms an interface with the non-magnetic spacer 29. The present disclosure also encompasses a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) free layer structure. In particular, the SAF free layer in each of the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 2-9 may be modified to a SyF configuration by adjusting the thickness of the coupling layer 33 between FL1 layer 31 and FL2 layer 35. Moreover, in a dual SyF free layer embodiment, the thickness of both coupling layers 33, 38 is changed. Note that antiferromagnetic coupling is realized when the thickness of coupling layer 33 (and 38) is preferably 4, 9, or 13 Angstroms. However, when the coupling layer thickness is changed to 6 Angstroms or less than 3 Angstroms, then a SyF free layer structure is established wherein the magnetization of FL1 and FL2 layers are aligned in the same perpendicular to plane direction rather than in opposite directions for FL1 and FL2 in SAF embodiments. Thus, a SyF free layer according to one embodiment of the present disclosure has a FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration where all the layers have a composition as described in previous embodiments and wherein the coupling layer thickness is limited to 6 Angstroms or less than 3 Angstroms. In a dual SyF free layer configuration, FL1, FL2, and FL3 have magnetic moments in the same perpendicular to plane direction in contrast to a dual SAF free layer structure where the FL1 and FL3 magnetization direction is opposite to that of the FL2 magnetic moment. Moreover, the dusting layers enhance the ferrimagnetic coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers. Although there is no beneficial reduction of Ho when a SyF free layer is employed, the SyF structure is believed to provide an advantage over a single free layer because of a higher magnetic volume and higher thermal stability. Once all of the layers in the MTJ stack are formed in the aforementioned embodiments, an annealing process may be performed that is comprised of a temperature between 200\u00b0 C. and 500\u00b0 C., and preferably between 300\u00b0 C. and 400\u00b0 C., for a period of 1 minute to 10 hours. Thereafter, the spin valve structure may be patterned to form a plurality of STT-MRAM memory cells or STO elements on the substrate 10 by a well known photolithography and etch sequence. In an embodiment where the substrate is a bottom electrode, the bottom electrode may be patterned simultaneously with the overlying spin valve stack to enable a higher density of patterned structures for advanced technology designs. EXAMPLE 1 To demonstrate the benefits of the present disclosure, a patterned MTJ stack was fabricated on a Si substrate according to a SAF free layer embodiment related to FIG. 2. The MTJ stack has a MgO/CoFeB5/Fe5/Mo9/Fe5/CoFeB5/MgTa0x6 configuration wherein the number following a layer composition is a thickness in Angstroms of that layer. MgO serves as a tunnel barrier layer, FL1 and FL2 layers are made of Co20Fe60B20, DL1 and DL2 layers are Fe, the coupling layer is a Mo film, and MgTaOx is the cap layer. The MgO layer was formed by first depositing an 8 Angstrom thick Mg layer followed by a radical oxidation (ROX), and then deposition of a 4 Angstrom thick Mg layer. The MgTaOx cap was formed by depositing a Mg:Ta film with a 2:1 ratio and then performing a ROX process, although a natural oxidation method could be used. In another embodiment, a sputter deposition process involving a MgTaOx target may be employed to form a MgTaOx capping layer. A seed layer and reference layer are omitted for this study. All layers were deposited at RT and the stack was annealed at 300\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. As pictured in FIG. 10, synthetic antiferromagnetic coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers is achieved in the remanent state between applied field \u2212300 Oe and 300 Oe using the SAF free layer structure of this experiment. Results were obtained by magneto- optical microscopy. A similar result is anticipated when CoFeB in FL1 and FL2 layers is replaced by a laminated stack, a L10 ordered alloy, or a RE-TM film as explained earlier. In this example, we rely on MgO and MgTaOx layers to induce PMA in the CoFeB FL1 and FL2 layers, respectively, and the Fe/Mo/Fe stack is used to enhance RKKY coupling. EXAMPLE 2 Referring to FIG. 11, a second experiment was performed to demonstrate that synthetic ferrimagnetic coupling is achieved between FL1 and FL2 layers in a SyF embodiment according to the present disclosure. A patterned MTJ stack with a MgO/CoFeB5/Co4/Ru6/Co4/CoFeB5/MgTa0x6 configuration was fabricated on a Si substrate. The MgO tunnel barrier, CoFeB FL1 and FL2 layers, and MgTaOx cap layer are the same as in the first experiment (Example 1). However, dusting layers DL1 and DL2 are changed to 4 Angstrom thick Co films, and the coupling layer is Ru with a 6 Angstrom thickness. The MTJ stack was annealed at 300\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. Free layer magnetic properties are measured perpendicular to the film plane with magneto-optical microscopy and show synthetic ferrimagnetic coupling through a RKKY effect. Note that the plot is consistent with a magnetic state wherein the magnetizations of FL1 and FL2 layers are aligned in the same direction and are perpendicular to the film plane. The advantages of the SAF embodiments of the present disclosure are improved PMA (Hc and Hk) for a free layer in a magnetic device, and a lower offset field (Ho) on the free layer for better stability. Alternatively, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be CoFeB or CoNiFeB to enhance the MR ratio while realizing a slight loss in PMA strength. Furthermore, there is enhanced Ku (thermal stability) in the free layer to enable high temperature processing up to at least 400\u00b0 C. that makes the multilayer stacks described herein suitable for a variety of applications including advanced STT-MRAM devices. Higher thermal stability also increases the retention time of the memory cell for STT-MRAM designs. While this disclosure has been particularly shown and described with reference to, the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in, the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.",

The SAF free layer may be used with a SAF reference layer in STT-MRAM memory elements or in spintronic devices including a spin transfer oscillator. Furthermore, a dual SAF structure is described that may provide further advantages in terms of Ho, PMA, and thermal stability.",

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) DETECTION OF PERMEABILITY ANISOTROPY IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] Aspects relate to testing of geological formations. More specifically, aspects relate to detection of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane of a geological formation using a single-packer system. BACKGROUND INFORMATION [0002] In petroleum reservoirs, permeability affects the overall production capability of a wellbore. Permeability can vary greatly based upon several factors, including the overall type of material that the wellbore penetrates. Permeability can also change in a wellbore as the wellbore progresses through increasing lengths. Vertical permeability anisotropy refers to the change of permeability as the wellbore penetrates layer upon layer in the geological stratum. [0003] Permeability, however, may also change in the horizontal plane. Horizontal permeability anisotropy can be just as important, if not more important, to the petroleum well. Such horizontal plane anisotropy can affect the overall well output if the horizontal permeability components vary a great deal or if the anisotropy is located in specific areas of the geological stratum. Identification of such horizontal anisotropy, however, is difficult. There are currently no standardized tests to determine horizontal permeability anisotropy for geological stratum. In addition to the above, single-packer configurations or probe configurations have not been utilized to determine such horizontal permeability anisotropy. [0004] Finding a statistically meaningful method to determine horizontal permeability anisotropy can provide large benefits for operators of well drilling equipment. If extreme variation of horizontal permeability components is found, such seemingly profitable payzones in formations may be discarded in favor of more productive formation features. [0005] Such investigations can minimize needless drilling in remote areas, for example, if the need for such drilling would not provide dividends in light of the expanded costs of drilling. Investigations performed in high value wells, such as deep water ocean drilling, where costs can range in the millions of dollars per day, can have a significant impact on the overall return of drilling. In addition to the above, there is a need to be able to identify horizontal permeability anisotropy with downhole equipment, away from expensive laboratory tests used in conventional applications. Such field capable identification would be of significant benefit as no conventional applications exist that would quickly and reliably identify horizontal permeability anisotropic conditions in modern wellbores and well drilling. SUMMARY [0006] In one example embodiment, a method for detection of horizontal permeability anisotropy is disclosed comprising positioning a formation testing tool within a wellbore formed within a subsurface reservoir, conducting a series of three flow tests with the testing tool wherein a first test is a four drain flow test, a second test is a pair of opposite drains flowing on diametrically opposite sides of the formation testing tool and a third test is a second pair of opposite drains flowing on opposite drains different than the second test; determining one of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility of the reservoir based on measuring a flow response of the subsurface reservoir one of at and adjacent to the flowing drains, determining one of orthogonal components of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility based on the measured flow response; and determining a direction of the orthogonal components of one of the horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility with respect to the orientation of the formation testing tool based on a measured flow response.

[0008] In another example embodiment, the method may be accomplished wherein the single packer has four symmetrically shaped drains to enable fluid communication with the subsurface reservoir.

[0036] FIG. 5 is a flowchart for a method for detection of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane of a single packer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0037] Horizontal permeability anisotropy is a significant geological feature that affects the overall economic viability of a drilling operation. In conventional apparatus and methods, operators must make best case assumptions of horizontal permeability anisotropy. No conventional tests exist using downhole tools for quickly determining horizontal permeability anisotropy. [0038] In wellbore completion, for example, new technologies such as single-packer systems may be used to isolate portions of wellbores for testing. Single-packer systems are ideal for such applications as these single-packer systems allow for easily transportable capability for downhole operations coupled with extensive holding/plugging capability. [0039] For single-packer systems, fluid is usually withdrawn from drains in a single packer simultaneously. The drains are located around the periphery of the single- packer system. The drains may be different shaped, such as with circular holes or may be elliptical holes. The single-packer systems are deployed downhole in an unexpanded state and then subsequently expanded. The expansion may occur through use of a mechanical expansion system that has, for example, slats that expand and contract based upon the signals of an operator. [0040] In some non-limiting single-packer embodiments for the present, for example, it is possible to withdraw fluid from two (2) drains located on diametrically opposite sides or portions of a single packer while the other two (2) drains are closed. In the context of the remaining specification, the two (2) drains that remain closed are considered observation drains. The two (2) flowing drains would be opposite each other as are static observation drains that are closed. The single-packer system may be configured, in some instances, such that the flowing and static observation drains can be switched. For example in a first test one (1 ) set of two (2) drains is flowing and the second set of two (2) drains is static. In the second test, the first original set of two drains that were flowing become static and the static drains become flowing drains. Such changes may be made by an operator located at the surface sending commands to the single-packer system to switch pump and valve configurations which operate the respective drains. [0041] To help in identifying pressure readings in single-packer systems, high resolution pressure gauges may be used in conjunction with the single-packer apparatus. Such pressure gauges may be located at the entry of the drain to the single packer or may be located near the entry of the drain. To that end, a single pressure gauge may be placed in each drain of the single-packer apparatus or a single pressure gauge may be placed for a pair of drains. [0042] Permeability determination with formation testing tools has received considerable attention in literature. In particular, the detection and quantification of permeability anisotropy in the vertical-horizontal plane, kv/kh has been the subject of many studies. The detection and quantification of permeability anisotropy within the horizontal plane, however, has received no attention. Understanding such anisotropy is critical for optimum design of reservoir drainage patterns, secondary and tertiary recovery projects and stimulation treatments, to name but a few examples. Anisotropy within the horizontal plane usually creates three-dimensional anisotropy with vertical permeability differing from both components of horizontal permeability, kx and ky. Aspects of the below described embodiments use a single packer for quantification of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane. [0043] A numerical finite-difference simulation model was developed to study the formation-pressure response for flow from a four (4) drain source. The model allowed for three dimensional \"3D\" flow from an x-y-z rectangular reservoir grid with no-flow outer boundaries. A single-phase slightly-compressible fluid with constant fluid properties was used. The drains were modeled as infinite-conductivity oval-shaped sources on the side of the wellbore. Two cases were studied wherein drains were aligned with the principal directions of horizontal permeability, and drains oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the permeability. These two cases represent the two extremes of drain alignment with respect to horizontal anisotropy. [0044] The model allowed the flow rate from each drain to be specified independently. Two cases were studied, the first where all four (4) drains flow at the same rate and the second being two (2) opposite drains flowing wherein the other two opposite drains are closed. The reservoir grid was very fine near the wellbore to approximate the circular wellbore shape and an oval drain shape. In the example, the smallest grid cells were 0.1 inch (.253 cm) cubes. The wellbore was placed at the center of the formation, in both the areal (x-y) and vertical (z) directions. [0045] To study the effect of anisotropy within the horizontal plane, the following test specific case test conditions were modeled: q=10 cm3/s for 100 hours, \u03a6 = 0.2, ct = 1 .8e-5 1/psi, rw = 4.25 inch, \u03bc = 1 cp, h=50 m, vertical well and mid-point of flowing interval centered vertically. Three cases were considered: 1 ) kx = ky = 10 millidarcy; 2) kx = 5 with ky = 20 millidarcy; 3) kx = 20 with ky = 5 millidarcy. For all cases the effective horizontal permeability, given by (kxky) 5 was 10 millidarcy. All cases had vertical permeability kz = 10 millidarcy. The drains of a single-packer module were aligned with kx and ky. It is noted that as long as the well is centered in the x-y plane, the results for anisotropic cases 2 and 3 are symmetric - for example, the pressure drop at the x- direction drains when ky >kx is the same as that at the y-direction drains when ky < kx. Cases 2 and 3 are therefore redundant, therefore the results for cases 1 and 2 are illustrated and described. Ct = total compressibility h = formation thickness kh = horizontal permeability in the x- and y-directions of a 2D anisotropic formation kv = vertical permeability in a 2D anisotropic formation kx = horizontal permeability in the x-direction of a 3D anisotropic formation ky= horizontal permeability in the y-direction of a 3D anisotropic formation kz = vertical permeability (in the z-direction) of a 3D anisotropic formation q = flow rate rw = wellbore radius \u0394\u03a1 = pressure change since start of test At = time since start of test \u03bc = viscosity \u03a6 = porosity [0046] For the purposes of this specification the term \"anisotropy\" refers to a variation of a property with the direction in which it is measured. For example, rock permeability is a measure of its conductivity to fluid flow through the pore spaces. Reservoir rocks often exhibit permeability anisotropy whereby conductivity to fluid depends on the direction of flow of the fluid. This is most often true when comparing permeability measured parallel or substantially parallel to the formation bed boundaries, which may be referred to as horizontal permeability, hereinafter defined kh and permeability measured perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the formation bed boundaries, which may be referred to as vertical permeability, hereinafter defined kv. Such permeability anisotropy is referred to as two-dimensional (hereinafter \"2D\") anisotropy. In some cases, there may be anisotropy within the plane parallel or substantially parallel to the formation bed boundaries, such that instead of a single value of horizontal permeability, directions, such as for example x- and y-directions, referred to as kx and ky respectively are present. Rock that exhibits variation in permeability when measured vertically or substantially vertically, as well as, both horizontal or substantially horizontal directions is said to have three-dimensional (hereinafter \"3D\") anisotropy. Soils or rock that exhibits no directional variation in permeability is referred to as \"isotropic\". \"Mobility\" is a measure of permeability divided by the viscosity of the fluid. [0047] FIG. 1A shows the pressure change and derivative results on a log-log scale for all four (4) drains flowing of a single-packer system that is deployed in a wellbore. Figures 1 A through 1 F and 2A through 2C, the drains are aligned with anisotropy. FIG. 1 B presents the pressure change results on a semilog scale. There is some sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy, however, the values show a constant offset of the value of change in pressure (\u0394\u03a1). It may not be concluded, therefore if ky >kx or if one/both of the x-direction drains have some skin damage relative to the y-direction drains. In the values shown, \u0394\u03a1\u03a7 is lower than \u0394\u03a1 isotropic after a few seconds when ky>kx. This implies that even when facing the lower permeability (kx), the x-direction drains are influenced by the higher permeability (ky). Both anisotropic cases would yield negative skin if interpreted with an isotropic model. [0048] FIGS. 1 C through 1 F display the results for two opposite-drains flowing. The responses at the flowing drains (FIGS. 1 C and 1 D) show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy and are similar to the four (4) drain flowing cases. The responses at the observation drains (FIGS. 1 E and 1 F) show sensitivity to anisotropy; these drains are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for the x- and y-direction drains, however are nearly identical. Thus, the observation drains allow detection of horizontal anisotropy and quantification of the component values, but it would not be possible to determine which component value is kx and which is ky. [0049] A second set of cases, with larger anisotropy, was considered: kx = 2.5 with ky = 40 millidarcy and kx = 40 with ky = 2.5 millidarcy. The results are similar to those of FIGS. 1 A through 1 F. To summarize the results, FIGS. 2A through 2C display the semilog pressure responses for all cases of the drains aligned with permeability. FIG. 2A shows that when all four (4) drains are flowing there is sensitivity to the magnitude and direction of horizontal anisotropy; however the values determined look like a skin effect. All anisotropic cases would yield negative skin if interpreted with an isotropic model regardless of the direction of anisotropy. As anisotropy grows, for example, the negative skin becomes larger. In FIG. 2A, the change in pressure (\u0394\u03a1) in pounds per square inch ranges from a low value of approximately thirty (30) pounds per square inch to a high value of one hundred forty (140) pounds per square inch. For the x ordinate, the change in time from the start of sampling At in hours ranges up to one hundred (100) hours. As can be seen for the various plots of ky/kx for the values of 1 , 4 and 16, values of change in pressure increase up to approximately .01 hour and then tend to flatten after that elapsed time period. [0050] FIG. 2B shows that when two opposite-drains flow, the response at the flowing drains show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy at the x-direction and y-direction drains. The responses are similar to the four (4) drains flowing cases. [0051] FIG. 2C shows that when two (2) opposite drains flow, the responses at the observation drains show sensitivity to anisotropy. The observation drains are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for the x- and y- direction drains, however, are nearly identical. The observation drains allow for the determination of the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy but not the direction (i.e. cannot determine if ky > kx or kx > ky). [0052] The port numbers for the all FIGS. 1 through 4 are numbered as port number 1 which relates to drain number 1 , port number 2 which relates to drain number 2, port number 3 which relates to drain number 3 and port number 4 which relates to drain number 4. As will be understood, and used throughout the specification, the value of one darcy is referenced to a mixture of unit systems wherein a permeability of 1 darcy permits a flow of 1 cm3/s of a fluid with viscosity of 1 cP wherein 1 P = 1 gram cm\"1 s~1. Permeability values range from as high as 1000000 darcys for gravel to less than 0.01 microdarcy for hard stones such as granite. [0053] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate examples when four (4) drains are flowing. For Figures 3A through F and 4 A through 4c, the drains are aligned at 45 degrees with respect to horizontal anisotropy. FIG. 3A presents the results on a log-log scale while Figure 3B illustrates the results on a semilog scale. As presented, there is some sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy, but the results indicate a constant offset of \u0394\u03a1. There is an absence of sensitivity to the direction of anisotropy, wherein the responses at all drains are identical and the responses for ky/kx = 4 and ky/kx = \u017a are identical. FIGS. 3C through 3F display the results for two opposite drains flowing. The responses at the flowing drains (FIGS. 3C and 3D) show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy and are similar to the four drains flowing cases. The responses at the observation drains (FIGS. 3e and 3F) show sensitivity to anisotropy and are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for all drains are identical. This, the observation drains would allow detection of horizontal anisotropy and quantification of the component values, but it would not be possible to determine which component value kx and which is ky. [0054] A second set of cases, with larger anisotropy, was considered: kx = 2.5 with ky = 40 millidarcy and kx = 40 with ky = 2.5 millidarcy. The results are similar to those of FIGS. 3A through 3F. To summarize the results, FIGS. 4A through 4C display the semilog pressure responses for all cases of the drains oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal permeability directions. [0055] Referring to FIG. 4A, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure, \u0394\u03a1, in pounds per square in inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time, \u0394\u03a1, in hours, is provided. FIG. 4A illustrates the change in pressure, \u0394\u03a1 at flowing drains, when all four (4) drains are flowing. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx = ky, and ky kx = 4 or ky/kx = 16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394\u03a1) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 hours (approximately three hundred sixty (360) seconds). The maximum change in pressure in pounds per square inch is approximately 140 pounds per square inch. For the cases where kx = ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx = 4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky = twenty (20) millidarcy and forty (40) millidarcy accordingly. [0056] Referring to FIG. 4B, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure \u0394\u03a1 in pounds per square in inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time, in hours, is provided wherein the change in pressure is at flowing drains (not observation drains as will be described below in conjunction with FIG. 4C). FIG. 4B shows that when two opposite drains flow, the responses at the flowing drains show sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx = ky, and ky/kx = 4 or ky/kx = 16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394\u03a1) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near two hundred forty (240) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 hours (approximately 36 seconds). The maximum change in pressure in pounds per square inch is approximately two hundred thirty (230) pounds per square inch. For the cases where kx = ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx = 4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky = twenty (20) millidarcy and forty (40) millidarcy accordingly. [0057] Referring to FIG. 4C, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure (\u0394\u03a1), in pounds per square inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time At, in hours, is provided in the X axis wherein the change is pressure is different than in FIG. 4B as the change in pressure is at observations drains when two opposite drains are flowing. In this case, two (2) opposite drains flow and the responses at the observations drains show sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx = ky, and ky/kx = 4 or ky/kx = 16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394\u03a1) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near sixty (60) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 hours (approximately 36 seconds). For the cases where kx = ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx = 4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky = twenty (20) millidarcy and forty (40) millidarcy accordingly. [0058] Referring to FIG. 5, a method 500 for detection of permeability anisotropy is disclosed. The method 500, comprises positioning a formation testing tool within a wellbore formed within a subsurface reservoir 502 and conducting a series of three flow tests with the testing tool wherein a first test is a four drain flow test, a second test is a pair of opposite drains flowing on diametrically opposite sides of the formation testing tool and a third test is a second pair of opposite drains flowing on opposite drains different than the second test 504. The method also comprises determining one of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility of the reservoir based on measuring a flow response of the subsurface reservoir one of at and adjacent to the flowing drains 506 and determining one of orthogonal components of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility based on the measured flow response 508. The method 500 may also comprise determining a direction of the orthogonal components of one of the horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility with respect to the orientation of the formation testing tool based on a measured flow response 510. [0059] While the aspects have been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein.",

        "Description": "Description SUMMARY Various embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to a thin film that is tuned for various magnetic characteristics. In accordance with various embodiments, a magnetic layer is tuned to a predetermined anisotropy and magnetic moment and is formed over a cryogenic substrate. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a block representation of an example data storage device in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 2 provides an isometric block representation of a portion of a data storage device in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 3 shows an isometric block representation of an example magnetic layer in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 4 displays a top view block representation of an example magnetic layer tuned in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 5 plots performance data generally associated with magnetic elements constructed and operated in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 6 graphs various operational characteristics of a magnetic element constructed and operated in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 7 provides a flowchart of a thin film fabrication routine conducted in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Continuing emphasis for larger capacity, faster data storage devices has stressed the magnetic stability of data storage elements, especially in smaller form factor devices. High uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment may aid in mitigating performance instabilities, in thin film magnetic layers used in a variety of rotating and solid state data storage devices. However, uniaxial anisotropy can be difficult to maintain in magnetic thin films subsequent to heat treatment that may occur during manufacturing or operation. Hence, industry is striving to provide thermally stable magnetic thin films capable of preserving uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment despite exposure to elevated temperatures. Accordingly, a thin film may be constructed as a magnetic layer that is tuned to a predetermined anisotropy and magnetic moment through deposition of a material on a substrate cooled to a predetermined substrate temperature and with a predetermined deposition incidence angle. The ability to provide predetermined uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment in a magnetic layer by adjusting the temperature of a substrate on which the magnetic layer is deposited can allow the magnetic layer to be tuned to perform in a variety of different magnetic operating environments, such as small form factor data reading and writing. The construction of a magnetic thin film in accordance with various embodiments may at least increase high frequency magnetic performance through coherent magnetic rotation while boosting robustness of the thin film's thermal stability. The deposition of one or more thin films on a substrate cooled to cryogenic temperatures, such as 50K, can control magnetic domain structure, which may maintain stress anisotropy in obliquely sputtered thin films and correspond to increased thermal and anisotropic stability. With a cryogenically cooled substrate, oblique incidence angle tuning may further increase the thermal and anisotropic stability by precisely controlling the anisotropy and magnetic moment of the thin film. Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 generally illustrates a block representation of an example data storage device 100. The data storage device 100 may take the form of a variety of different data storage technologies, such as rotating, solid state, and hybrid systems, which can be practiced in a variety of non-limiting mobile, server, and residential environments. The data storage device 100 may be configured at least with a controller 102 that directs inputted data signals 104 to a data storage element 106. The inputted data signals 104 may originate at an unlimited variety of locations, such as from external data storage devices and internal data cache, and correspond to data intended to be stored either temporarily or permanently on the data storage element 106. It should be noted that the size, speed, type, and number of data storage elements 106 are not limited to a particular configuration. That is, any storage element capable of retaining data for future access, such as a rotating data media, solid state cell, and hybrid data system, can be used to provide any data capacity and transfer speed configuration as the data storage element 106 either alone or in combination. Regardless of the type and capacity of the data storage element 106, the controller 102 may be capable of handling the inputted data 104 as well as providing data output signals 108 from the data storage element 106. As such, the controller 102 can selectively input data to and output data from one or more regions of the data storage element 106, either successively or concurrently. In some embodiments, the data storage element 106 is constructed with at least one thin film magnetic layer that is magnetically fixed or free to allow data to be stored, written, and read via the controller 102. For example, the thin film magnetic layer may be a part of a magnetoresistive lamination used to sense data programmed as data bits on a rotating data media. In another example, the thin film magnetic layer may be part of a solid state lamination, such as resistive random access memory (RRAM), that stores data with the formation of a filament between two electrodes. FIG. 2 displays an isometric block representation of an example thin film magnetic layer 120 capable of being used in the data storage element 106 of FIG. 1. The magnetic layer 120 is shown in a rectangular form with a thickness 122, stripe height 124, and width 126, but such shape and the particular dimensions of the layer 120 are not limited to a particular configuration. Regardless of the shape and dimensions of the magnetic layer 120, a uniaxial anisotropy 128 that is parallel to the transverse direction of the magnetic layer 120 and the X axis may be constructed to increase magnetic domain control versus omniaxial anisotropy. Such a uniaxial anisotropic orientation may allow for magnetically stable performance at predetermined magnetic flux densities, such as 2.4 Tesla. However, the uniaxial anisotropy 128 may alternatively be tuned to an angled orientation 130 with respect to both the X and Y axis to maintain magnetic performance of the layer 120 when the stripe height 124 is increased. In other words, an increasingly stripe height 126 can correspond with elevated magnetic instability that is mitigated by tilting the orientation of the uniaxial anisotropy 128 to the angled uniaxial anisotropy 130 oriented non-normal to the X and Y axis. As the stripe height 124 reaches a predetermined length, such as twice the width 126, a uniaxial anisotropy 132 oriented at an angle normal to the X axis may be formed in the magnetic layer 120 to bolster magnetic stability. For example, orienting the uniaxial anisotropy parallel to the width of the magnetic layer 120 along the X axis may lower erasure after write phenomenon as the anisotropy 128 allows magnetization to relax faster than if the anisotropy was oriented along the X axis, as in anisotropy 132, or angled to the X axis, as in anisotropy 130. While the orientation of the uniaxial anisotropy of the magnetic layer 120 can be tuned along with the dimensions of the magnetic layer 120 to provide predetermined magnetic characteristics, the application of heat to the magnetic layer, such as during annealing or operation, can permanently alter the anisotropy and magnetic moment of a magnetic layer 120, regardless of how the anisotropy and magnetic moment was configured prior to the application of heat. With the application of heat inducing anisotropy and moment instability in the magnetic layer 120, tuning the temperature of the substrate on which the magnetic layer 120 is deposited and the angle in which the magnetic layer 120 is deposited can aid in maintaining anisotropy and moment characteristics subsequent to an application of heat. FIG. 3 shows an isometric block representation of the deposition of a magnetic layer 150 onto a substrate 152 in accordance with various embodiments. As with the magnetic layer 120 of FIG. 2, the magnetic layer 150 can be formed in any variety of shapes, dimensions, and materials, but in some embodiments is a rectangular thin film formed through the sputtered deposition of FeCo onto the substrate 152 at a predetermined oblique incidence angles \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83 that can range from 0 up to 90 degrees with respect to the Z axis. Static or dynamic oblique angle sputtering, such as angles at or below 30 degrees, can produce elevated anisotropy, such as 200 Oe or above due to stress anisotropy being created by the agglomeration of vacancies and nano-voids formed behind growing crystallites due to shadowing effects of the oblique angle, without losing the inherent magnetic moment of the material. That is, growing crystallites block the line of sight from the incident beam of the sputtering gun 154 to produce vacancies in predictable locations that collectively produce stress anisotropy which leads to magnetic anisotropy in the film. The magnetic layer 160 of FIG. 4 generally illustrates how vacancies 162 align in predictable rows 164 aligned with a predetermined anisotropy direction 166 to produce uniaxial anisotropy along that direction 166. However, the thermal stability of the rows 164 becomes unstable in the presence of elevated heat as stress anisotropy lowers. Hence, conditions like annealing or heat treating the magnetic layer 160 can disturb the strength and direction of the uniaxial anisotropy. It should be noted that the material of the magnetic layer may be doped with a larger atomic radius element to mitigate thermal instability, but such efforts often lower the overall magnetic moment of the magnetic layer 160 to the detriment of high frequency data bit access operations. With the thermal instability of uniaxial anisotropy in mind, cooling the substrate, such as substrate 152 of FIG. 3, on which the magnetic layer 160 is deposited can reduce atomic mobility and more easily form vacancies 162 and nano-voids, which corresponds to increased thermal stability of the vacancy 162 alignment along the predetermined anisotropy direction 166. In various embodiments, the anisotropy and magnetic moment are tuned by cryogenically cooling the substrate to a predetermined temperature, such as approximately 50 Kelvin, while the oblique angle of deposition is controlled. Such tuned deposition can provide constant or varying cryogenic substrate temperatures and oblique deposition angles optimized to produce elevated stress anisotropy can mitigate the detrimental effects of annealing and heat treatments by maintaining high uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment subsequent to applications of heat. FIGS. 5 and 6 respectively graph example operational data associated with magnetoresistive laminations including differently tuned magnetic layers in accordance with various embodiments. In FIG. 5, oblique deposition on a room temperature substrate is shown to provide easy 170 and hard 172 axis that is tuned to predetermined uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment characteristics. While the magnetic characteristics of FIG. 5 can be altered by adjusting the oblique incidence angle of deposition, subsequent heat treatment or annealing may reduce or eliminate the tuned anisotropy and magnetic moment as vacancies in one or more magnetic layers move in crystal lattices due to thermal stresses induced by the application of heat. In contrast, the easy 180 and hard 182 axis shown in FIG. 6 illustrate how tuning both oblique incidence angle and substrate temperature can produce increased uniaxial anisotropy, which is also more thermally stable due to reduce atomic mobility of the deposited magnetic material on a cryogenically cooled substrate. While formation of a magnetic element comprising a tuned magnetic layer is not limited to a particular means, FIG. 7 provides an example thin film fabrication routine 200 performed in accordance with various embodiments. The routine 200 may begin by designing uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment that corresponds with magnetic performance optimized for application in step 202. That is, the anisotropy and magnetic moment can be designed in step 202 to provide magnetic characteristics, such as anisotropy direction and magnetic flux capacity, catered to the manner in which the thin film is to be used, such as a solid state lamination, magnetoresistive lamination, and proximity sensor. With the uniaxial anisotropy and magnetic moment designed in step 202, oblique incidence angle and substrate temperature that corresponds to those magnetic parameters are then set for execution in steps 204 and 206, respectively. Step 204 first cools and maintains the substrate to a cryogenic temperature before step 206 configures a layer deposition means, such as a sputtering apparatus, to a predetermined oblique incidence angle. The configuration of the substrate to a cooled temperature and an oblique deposition set to a predetermined angle advances the routine 200 to step 208 where deposition of the thin film onto the cooled substrate begins. Sometime after the start of material deposition in step 208, the deposition is evaluated in decision 210 as to whether adjustment of the substrate temperature or oblique incidence angle is to be adjusted. That is, whether the previously static substrate temperature and oblique incidence angle are to become dynamic while material is being deposited onto the substrate. If the determination from decision 210 is that modification is in order, step 212 alters the substrate temperature and/or the oblique incidence angle either individually or collectively while depositing material onto the cooled substrate. The formation of the thin film in a predetermined shape, thickness, width, and stripe height either after the alteration of the deposition parameters in step 212 or without alteration from decision 210 leads to step 214 where the deposition is terminated. Various embodiments maintain the substrate at a cryogenic temperature even after deposition while other embodiments submit the newly formed thin film to annealing heat treatments at elevated temperatures, both of which are not required or limiting to routine 200. While not provided in routine 200, the thin film may be fabricated in isolation or as part of a lamination where additional layers are deposited atop the tuned thin film formed in routine 200. It should be noted that the routine 200 is not limited to the process shown in FIG. 7 as various decisions and steps can be omitted, changed, and added. For example, multiple adjustments can be made to oblique incidence angle and/or substrate temperature between steps 208 and 214. Regardless of the manifestation of routine 200, the fabricated thin film is tuned with a uniaxial anisotropy direction, anisotropy strength, and magnetic moment that is optimized for stability, especially in regard to retaining magnetic characteristics after the application of heat. It can be appreciated that the configuration and material characteristics of the magnetic thin film described in the present disclosure allows for a magnetic layer optimized for anisotropic and thermal stability. The ability to tune the magnetic layer for increased uniaxial anisotropy with oblique incidence angle deposition combines with deposition onto a cryogenically cooled substrate to provide a robust magnetic thin film capable of increasing data bit capacity and data transfer rates of data storage devices. Additionally, it will be appreciated that the claimed technology can readily be utilized in any number of magnetic applications, such as data sensing, data writing, and solid state data storage applications. It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments, this detailed description is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangements of parts within the principles of the present disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the particular elements may vary depending on the particular application without departing from the spirit and scope of the present technology.",

        "Description": "Description CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS None. FIELD OF THE INVENTION Aspects relate to testing of geological formations. More specifically, aspects relate to detection of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane of a geological formation using a single-packer system. BACKGROUND INFORMATION In petroleum reservoirs, permeability affects the overall production capability of a wellbore. Permeability can vary greatly based upon several factors, including the overall type of material that the wellbore penetrates. Permeability can also change in a wellbore as the wellbore progresses through increasing lengths. Vertical permeability anisotropy refers to the change of permeability as the wellbore penetrates layer upon layer in the geological stratum. Permeability, however, may also change in the horizontal plane. Horizontal permeability anisotropy can be just as important, if not more important, to the petroleum well. Such horizontal plane anisotropy can affect the overall well output if the horizontal permeability components vary a great deal or if the anisotropy is located in specific areas of the geological stratum. Identification of such horizontal anisotropy, however, is difficult. There are currently no standardized tests to determine horizontal permeability anisotropy for geological stratum. In addition to the above, single-packer configurations or probe configurations have not been utilized to determine such horizontal permeability anisotropy. Finding a statistically meaningful method to determine horizontal permeability anisotropy can provide large benefits for operators of well drilling equipment. If extreme variation of horizontal permeability components is found, such seemingly profitable payzones in formations may be discarded in favor of more productive formation features. Such investigations can minimize needless drilling in remote areas, for example, if the need for such drilling would not provide dividends in light of the expanded costs of drilling. Investigations performed in high value wells, such as deep water ocean drilling, where costs can range in the millions of dollars per day, can have a significant impact on the overall return of drilling. In addition to the above, there is a need to be able to identify horizontal permeability anisotropy with downhole equipment, away from expensive laboratory tests used in conventional applications. Such field capable identification would be of significant benefit as no conventional applications exist that would quickly and reliably identify horizontal permeability anisotropic conditions in modem wellbores and well drilling. SUMMARY In one example embodiment, a method for detection of horizontal permeability anisotropy is disclosed comprising positioning a formation testing tool within a wellbore formed within a subsurface reservoir, conducting a series of three flow tests with the testing tool wherein a first test is a four drain flow test, a second test is a pair of opposite drains flowing on diametrically opposite sides of the formation testing tool and a third test is a second pair of opposite drains flowing on opposite drains different than the second test; determining one of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility of the reservoir based on measuring a flow response of the subsurface reservoir one of at and adjacent to the flowing drains, determining one of orthogonal components of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility based on the measured flow response; and determining a direction of the orthogonal components of one of the horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility with respect to the orientation of the formation testing tool based on a measured flow response.

In another example embodiment, the method may be accomplished wherein the single packer has four symmetrically shaped drains to enable fluid communication with the subsurface reservoir. In another example embodiment, the method may be accomplished wherein the method is performed in a sub-sea wellbore. In another example embodiment, the method may be accomplished wherein the single-packer module is configured with two pairs of drains. In another example embodiment, the method may be accomplished wherein the conducted series of three flow tests includes using a single-packer module in the downhole environment and expanding the single-packer module to the exterior sides the wellbore.

FIG. 5 is a flowchart for a method for detection of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane of a single packer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Horizontal permeability anisotropy is a significant geological feature that affects the overall economic viability of a drilling operation. In conventional apparatus and methods, operators must make best case assumptions of horizontal permeability anisotropy. No conventional tests exist using downhole tools for quickly determining horizontal permeability anisotropy. In wellbore completion, for example, new technologies such as single-packer systems may be used to isolate portions of wellbores for testing. Single-packer systems are ideal for such applications as these single-packer systems allow for easily transportable capability for downhole operations coupled with extensive holding/plugging capability. For single-packer systems, fluid is usually withdrawn from drains in a single packer simultaneously. The drains are located around the periphery of the single-packer system. The drains may be different shaped, such as with circular holes or may be elliptical holes. The single-packer systems are deployed downhole in an unexpanded state and then subsequently expanded. The expansion may occur through use of a mechanical expansion system that has, for example, slats that expand and contract based upon the signals of an operator. In some non -limiting single-packer embodiments for the present, for example, it is possible to withdraw fluid from two (2) drains located on diametrically opposite sides or portions of a single packer while the other two (2) drains are closed. In the context of the remaining specification, the two (2) drains that remain closed are considered observation drains. The two (2) flowing drains would be opposite each other as are static observation drains that are closed. The single-packer system may be configured, in some instances, such that the flowing and static observation drains can be switched. For example in a first test one (1) set of two (2) drains is flowing and the second set of two (2) drains is static. In the second test, the first original set of two drains that were flowing become static and the static drains become flowing drains. Such changes may be made by an operator located at the surface sending commands to the single-packer system to switch pump and valve configurations which operate the respective drains. To help in identifying pressure readings in single-packer systems, high resolution pressure gauges may be used in conjunction with the single-packer apparatus. Such pressure gauges may be located at the entry of the drain to the single packer or may be located near the entry of the drain. To that end, a single pressure gauge may be placed in each drain of the single-packer apparatus or a single pressure gauge may be placed for a pair of drains. Permeability determination with formation testing tools has received considerable attention in literature. In particular, the detection and quantification of permeability anisotropy in the vertical-horizontal plane, kv/kh has been the subject of many studies. The detection and quantification of permeability anisotropy within the horizontal plane, however, has received no attention. Understanding such anisotropy is critical for optimum design of reservoir drainage patterns, secondary and tertiary recovery projects and stimulation treatments, to name but a few examples. Anisotropy within the horizontal plane usually creates three-dimensional anisotropy with vertical permeability differing from both components of horizontal permeability, kx and ky. Aspects of the below described embodiments use a single packer for quantification of permeability anisotropy in the horizontal plane. A numerical finite-difference simulation model was developed to study the formation-pressure response for flow from a four (4) drain source. The model allowed for three dimensional \u00933D\u0094 flow from an x-y-z rectangular reservoir grid with no-flow outer boundaries. A single-phase slightly-compressible fluid with constant fluid properties was used. The drains were modeled as infinite-conductivity oval-shaped sources on the side of the wellbore. Two cases were studied wherein drains were aligned with the principal directions of horizontal permeability, and drains oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the permeability. These two cases represent the two extremes of drain alignment with respect to horizontal anisotropy. The model allowed the flow rate from each drain to be specified independently. Two cases were studied, the first where all four (4) drains flow at the same rate and the second being two (2) opposite drains flowing wherein the other two opposite drains are closed. The reservoir grid was very fine near the wellbore to approximate the circular wellbore shape and an oval drain shape. In the example, the smallest grid cells were 0.1 inch (0.253 cm) cubes. The wellbore was placed at the center of the formation, in both the a real (x-y) and vertical (z) directions. To study the effect of anisotropy within the horizontal plane, the following test specific case test conditions were modeled: q=10 cm3/s for 100 hours, \u03c6=0.2, c1=1.8e-5 1/psi, rw=4.25 inch, \u03bc=1 cp, h=50 m, vertical well and mid-point of flowing interval centered vertically. Three cases were considered: 1) kx=ky=10 millidarcy; 2) kx=5 with ky=20 millidarcy; 3) kx=20 with ky=5 millidarcy. For all cases the effective horizontal permeability, given by (kxky)\u22125 was 10 millidarcy. All cases had vertical permeability kz=10 millidarcy. The drains of a single-packer module were aligned with kx and ky. It is noted that as long as the well is centered in the x-y plane, the results for anisotropic cases 2 and 3 are symmetric\u0097for example, the pressure drop at the x-direction drains when ky>kx is the same as that at the y-direction drains when ky<kx. Cases 2 and 3 are therefore redundant, therefore the results for cases 1 and 2 are illustrated and described. ct=total compressibility h=formation thickness kh=horizontal permeability in the x- and y-directions of a 2D anisotropic formation kv=vertical permeability in a 2D anisotropic formation kx=horizontal permeability in the x-direction of a 3D anisotropic formation ky=horizontal permeability in the y-direction of a 3D anisotropic formation kz=vertical permeability (in the z-direction) of a 3D anisotropic formation q=flow rate rw=wellbore radius \u0394P=pressure change since start of test \u0394t=time since start of test \u03bc=viscosity \u03c6=porosity For the purposes of this specification the term \u0093anisotropy\u0094 refers to a variation of a property with the direction in which it is measured. For example, rock permeability is a measure of its conductivity to fluid flow through the pore spaces. Reservoir rocks often exhibit permeability anisotropy whereby conductivity to fluid depends on the direction of flow of the fluid. This is most often true when comparing permeability measured parallel or substantially parallel to the formation bed boundaries, which may be referred to as horizontal permeability, hereinafter defined kh and permeability measured perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the formation bed boundaries, which may be referred to as vertical permeability, hereinafter defined kv. Such permeability anisotropy is referred to as two-dimensional (hereinafter \u00932D\u0094) anisotropy. In some cases, there may be anisotropy within the plane parallel or substantially parallel to the formation bed boundaries, such that instead of a single value of horizontal permeability, directions, such as for example x- and y-directions, referred to as kx and ky respectively are present. Rock that exhibits variation in permeability when measured vertically or substantially vertically, as well as, both horizontal or substantially horizontal directions is said to have three-dimensional (hereinafter \u00933D\u0094) anisotropy. Soils or rock that exhibits no directional variation in permeability is referred to as \u0093isotropic\u0094. \u0093Mobility\u0094 is a measure of permeability divided by the viscosity of the fluid. FIG. 1A shows the pressure change and derivative results on a log-log scale for all four (4) drains flowing of a single-packer system that is deployed in a wellbore. FIGS. 1A through 1F and 2A through 2C, the drains are aligned with anisotropy. FIG. 1B presents the pressure change results on a semilog scale. There is some sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy, however, the values show a constant offset of the value of change in pressure (\u0394P). It may not be concluded, therefore if ky>kx or if one/both of the x-direction drains have some skin damage relative to the y-direction drains. In the values shown, \u0394P, is lower than \u0394Pisotropic after a few seconds when ky>kx. This implies that even when facing the lower permeability (kx), the x-direction drains are influenced by the higher permeability (ky). Both anisotropic cases would yield negative skin if interpreted with an isotropic model. FIGS. 1C through 1F display the results for two opposite-drains flowing. The responses at the flowing drains (FIGS. 1C and 1D) show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy and are similar to the four (4) drain flowing cases. The responses at the observation drains (FIGS. 1E and 1F) show sensitivity to anisotropy; these drains are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for the x- and y-direction drains, however are nearly identical. Thus, the observation drains allow detection of horizontal anisotropy and quantification of the component values, but it would not be possible to determine which component value is kx and which is ky. A second set of cases, with larger anisotropy, was considered: kx=2.5 with ky=40 millidarcy and kx=40 with ky=2.5 millidarcy. The results are similar to those of FIGS. 1A through 1F. To summarize the results, FIGS. 2A through 2C display the semilog pressure responses for all cases of the drains aligned with permeability. FIG. 2A shows that when all four (4) drains are flowing there is sensitivity to the magnitude and direction of horizontal anisotropy; however the values determined look like a skin effect. All anisotropic cases would yield negative skin if interpreted with an isotropic model regardless of the direction of anisotropy. As anisotropy grows, for example, the negative skin becomes larger. In FIG. 2A, the change in pressure (\u0394P) in pounds per square inch ranges from a low value of approximately thirty (30) pounds per square inch to a high value of one hundred forty (140) pounds per square inch. For the x ordinate, the change in time from the start of sampling \u0394t in hours ranges up to one hundred (100) hours. As can be seen for the various plots of ky/kx for the values of 1, 4 and 16, values of change in pressure increase up to approximately 0.01 hour and then tend to flatten after that elapsed time period. FIG. 2B shows that when two opposite-drains flow, the response at the flowing drains show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy at the x-direction and y-direction drains. The responses are similar to the four (4) drains flowing cases. FIG. 2C shows that when two (2) opposite drains flow, the responses at the observation drains show sensitivity to anisotropy. The observation drains are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for the x- and y- direction drains, however, are nearly identical. The observation drains allow for the determination of the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy but not the direction (i.e. cannot determine if ky>kx or kx>ky). The port numbers for the all FIGS. 1 through 4 are numbered as port number 1 which relates to drain number 1, port number 2 which relates to drain number 2, port number 3 which relates to drain number 3 and port number 4 which relates to drain number 4. As will be understood, and used throughout the specification, the value of one darcy is referenced to a mixture of unit systems wherein a permeability of 1 darcy permits a flow of 1 cm3/s of a fluid with viscosity of 1 cP wherein 1 P=1 gram cm\u22121 s\u22121. Permeability values range from as high as 1000000 darcys for gravel to less than 0.01 microdarcy for hard stones such as granite. FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate examples when four (4) drains are flowing. For FIGS. 3A through F and 4A through 4 c, the drains are aligned at 45 degrees with respect to horizontal anisotropy. FIG. 3A presents the results on a log-log scale while FIG. 3B illustrates the results on a semilog scale. As presented, there is some sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy, but the results indicate a constant offset of \u0394P. There is an absence of sensitivity to the direction of anisotropy, wherein the responses at all drains are identical and the responses for ky/kx=4 and ky/kx=\u017a are identical. FIGS. 3C through 3F display the results for two opposite drains flowing. The responses at the flowing drains (FIGS. 3C and 3D) show sensitivity to horizontal anisotropy and are similar to the four drains flowing cases. The responses at the observation drains (FIGS. 3 e and 3F) show sensitivity to anisotropy and are not affected by skin so the responses would be clear evidence of anisotropy. The anisotropic responses for all drains are identical. This, the observation drains would allow detection of horizontal anisotropy and quantification of the component values, but it would not be possible to determine which component value kx and which is ky. A second set of cases, pith larger anisotropy, was considered: kx=2.5 with ky=40 millidarcy and kx=40 with ky=2.5 millidarcy. The results are similar to those of FIGS. 3A through 3F. To summarize the results, FIGS. 4A through 4C display the semilog pressure responses for all cases of the drains oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal permeability directions. Referring to FIG. 4A, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure, \u0394P, in pounds per square in inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time, \u0394P, in hours, is provided. FIG. 4A illustrates the change in pressure, \u0394P at flowing drains, when all four (4) drains are flowing. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx=ky, and ky/kx=4 or ky/kx=16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394P) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 our (approximately three hundred sixty (360) seconds). The maximum change in pressure in pounds per square inch is approximately 140 pounds per square inch. For the cases where kx=ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx=4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky=twenty (20) millidarcy and forty (40) millidarcy accordingly. Referring to FIG. 4B, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure \u0394P in pounds per square in inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time, in hours, is provided wherein the change in pressure is at flowing drains (not observation drains as will be described below in conjunction with FIG. 4C). FIG. 4B shows that when two opposite drains flow, the responses at the flowing drains show sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx=ky, and ky/kx=4 or ky/kx=16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394P) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near two hundred forty (240) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 hours (approximately 36 seconds). The maximum change in pressure in pounds per square inch is approximately two hundred thirty (230) pout s per square inch. For the cases where kx=ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx=4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky=twenty (20) millidaroy and forty (40) millidarcy accordingly. Referring to FIG. 4C, a graph is illustrated wherein the change of pressure (\u0394P), in pounds per square inch is provided in the Y axis and a change in time \u0394t, in hours, is provided in the X axis wherein the change is pressure is different than in FIG. 4B as the change in pressure is at observations drains when two opposite drains are flowing. In this case, two (2) opposite drains flow and the responses at the observations drains show sensitivity to the magnitude of horizontal anisotropy. Three different cases are provided, wherein kx=ky, and ky/kx=4 or ky/kx=16. As illustrated, values for change in pressure (\u0394P) in pounds per square inch range from zero (0) to near sixty (60) pounds per square inch. This occurs over a change in time period of approximately one hundred (100) hours. For all cases, of ky/kx values for change in pressure start to flatten at approximately 0.01 hours (approximately 36 seconds). For the cases where kx=ky, the values for kx and ky chosen for evaluation were ten (10) millidarcy. For the cases where ky/kx=4 and 16, the values for kx are first at five (5) millidarcy then 2.5 millidarcy and the values of ky=twenty (20) millidarcy and (40) millidarcy accordingly. Referring to FIG. 5, a method 500 for detection of permeability anisotropy is disclosed. The method 500, comprises positioning a formation testing tool within a wellbore formed within a subsurface reservoir 502 and conducting a series of three flow tests with the testing tool wherein a first test is a four drain flow test, a second test is a pair of opposite drains flowing on diametrically opposite sides of the formation testing tool and a third test is a second pair of opposite drains flowing on opposite drains different than the second test 504. The method also comprises determining one of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility of the reservoir based on measuring a flow response of the subsurface reservoir one of at and adjacent to the flowing drains 606 and determining one of orthogonal components of horizontal permeability and horizontal mobility based on the measured flow response 508.

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) ANALYSIS FOR QUANTIFYING MICROSCOPIC DIFFUSION ANISOTROPY Field of the invention The present invention relates to a method for quantifying microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a material with magnetic resonance imaging or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Technical Background Molecular self-diffusion measured with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) (Callaghan, 201 1 in \"Translational Dynamics & Magnetic Resonance\" (Oxford, Oxford University Press); Price, 2009 in \"NMR Studies of Translational Motion\" (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press)) is used to non-invasively study the morphology of the water-filled pore space of a wide range of materials, e.g., rocks (Hurlimann et al., 1994 \"Restricted diffusion in sedimentary rocks. Determination of surface-area-to-volume ratio and surface relaxivity\". J Magn Reson A 111, 169-178), emulsions (Topgaard et al., 2002, \"Restricted self-diffusion of water in a highly concentrated W/O emulsion studied using modulated gradient spin-echo NMR\". J Magn Reson 156, 195- 201 .), and cheese (Mariette et al., 2002, \"1H NMR diffusometry study of water in casein dispersions and gels\". J Agric Food Chem 50, 4295-4302.). Anisotropy of the pore structure renders the water self-diffusion anisotropic, a fact that is utilized for three-dimensional mapping of nerve fiber orientations in the white matter of the brain where the fibers have a preferential direction on macroscopic length scales (Basser et al., 1994, \"MR diffusion tensor spectroscopy and imaging\". Biophys J 66, 259-267; Beaulieu, 2002, \"The basis of anisotropic water diffusion in the nervous system - a technical review\". NMR Biomed 15, 435-455; Moseley et al. , 1991 , \"Anisotropy in diffusion-weighted MRI\". Magn Reson Med 19, 321 -326.). The degree of the macroscopic diffusion anisotropy is often quantified by the non- dimensional fractional anisotropy index (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996, \"Microstructural and physiological features of tissues elucidated by quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI\". J Magn Reson B 111, 209-219.). Also microscopic anisotropy in a globally isotropic material can be detected with diffusion NMR, originally through the characteristic curvature observed in the echo attenuation of conventional single-PGSE (pulsed gradient spin-echo) techniques (Callaghan and Soderman, 1983, in \"Examination of the lamellar phase of aerosol OT/water using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance\". J Phys Chem 87, 1737-1744; Topgaard and Soderman, 2002, in \"Self-diffusion in two- and three- dimensional powders of anisotropic domains: An NMR study of the diffusion of water in cellulose and starch\". J Phys Chem B 106, 1 1887-1 1892.) and, more recently, by using double-PGSE approaches in which the NMR signal is encoded for displacements over two separate time periods (Mitra, 1995, in \"Multiple wave-vector extension of the NMR pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo diffusion measurement\". Phys Rev B 51, 15074-15078.). The presence of microscopic anisotropy can be inferred by comparing echo attenuation data obtained with coiiinear and orthogonal displacement encoding (Callaghan and Komlosh, 2002, in \"Locally anisotropic motion in a macroscopically isotropic system: displacement correlations measured using double pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR\". Magn Reson Chem 40, S15-S19.; Komlosh et al., 2007, in \"Detection of microscopic anisotropy in gray matter and in novel tissue phantom using double Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo MR\". J Magn Reson 189, 38-45.; Komlosh et al., 2008, in \"Observation of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in the spinal cord using double-pulsed gradient spin echo MRI\". Magn Reson Med 59, 803-809.), by the characteristic signal modulations observed when varying the angle between the directions of displacement encoding (Mitra, 1995, in \"Multiple wave-vector extension of the NMR pulsed- field-gradient spin-echo diffusion measurement\". Phys Rev B 51, 15074- 15078.; Shemesh et al., 201 1 , in \"Probing Microscopic Architecture of Opaque Heterogeneous Systems Using Double-Pulsed-Field-Gradient NMR\".

Magn Reson Med 65, 1216-1227.), or by a two-dimensional correlation approach (Callaghan and Furo, 2004, in \"Diffusion-diffusion correlation and exchange as a signature for local order and dynamics\". J Chem Phys 120, 4032-4038; Hubbard et al., 2005, 2006, in \"A study of anisotropic water self-diffusion and defects in the lamellar mesophase\". Langmuir 21, 4340-4346, and \"Orientational anisotropy in polydomain lamellar phase of a lyotropic liquid crystal\". Langmuir 22, 3999-4003.). In typical diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments, only a voxel average anisotropy can be detected. Detection of microscopic anisotropy in a globally isotropic material through the characteristic echo attenuation curve in conventional single-PGSE techniques demands high diffusion weighting, often not feasible in clinical applications, and suffers from very low sensitivity to microscopic anisotropy. Information about microscopic anisotropy is further hindered in such experiments by possible isotropic diffusion contributions to the echo attenuation which are superposed to anisotropic contributions. The low sensitivity to microscopic anisotropy is the main pitfall also in analysis of data from double PGSE experiments. The present techniques are not adequately sensitive to microscopic anisotropy and are not best suited for clinical applications. Highly sensitive techniques to detect microscopic anisotropy, feasible for clinical applications, are thus needed. Furthermore, there is a need for a robust and fast data analysis approach allowing for an unambiguous quantification of microscopic anisotropy associated with a simple but concise parameter for its quantification. One aim of the present invention is to provide a new analysis method along with the novel parameter, microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391), providing a robust, fast and highly sensitive means for quantifying microscopic anisotropy, which is suitable in non-clinical and in clinical applications alike. Summary of the invention The stated purpose above is achieved by a method for quantifying microscopic diffusion anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity in a material by analysis of echo attenuation curves acquired with two different gradient modulations schemes, wherein one gradient modulation scheme is based on isotropic diffusion weighting and the other gradient modulation scheme is based on non-isotropic diffusion weighting, and wherein the method comprises analyzing by comparing the signal decays of the two acquired echo attenuation curves. The present analysis is highly sensitive to microscopic anisotropy independent of the particular choice of the isotropic diffusion weighting protocol. The analysis allows for a robust and fast quantification of microscopic anisotropy applicable in non-clinical and in clinical applications alike. The analysis could be applied in combination with multi-dimensional (2D, 3D ...) correlation MR experiments to quantify microscopic anisotropy of different diffusion components. The analysis could also be applied in combination with other NMR or MRI methods. Therefore, according to one specific embodiment of the present invention the method is performed in an NMR and/or MRI method or experiment, or in a combination with another NMR or MRI method. For example, with an additional isotropic-weighted experiment, the analysis could be combined with the diffusion tensor and/or diffusion kurtosis measurement to provide additional information about morphology and microscopic anisotropy as well as anisotropic orientation dispersion. The analysis can be used to facilitate and strengthen the interpretation of diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis measurements in vivo. For example, the analysis can provide information on the degree of anisotropy and on multi-exponential signal decays detected in kurtosis tensor measurements by attributing kurtosis to different isotropic and/or anisotropic diffusion contributions. The characterization of any pathology involving the change in microscopic anisotropy will benefit from the improvements that our method introduces. Brief description of the drawings Fig. 1 A-C show schematic representations of signal decays vs. b for isotropic (dashed line) and non-isotropic (solid line) diffusion weighting for different types of materials. The inset A depicts signal attenuation curves in case of anisotropic materials with 1 D or 2D curvilinear diffusion. The attenuation curves are multi-exponential for non-isotropic diffusion weighting, while they are mono-exponential for isotropic diffusion weighting. The deviation between the attenuation curves for isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting provides a measure of anisotropy. The inset B depicts an example of isotropic material with several apparent diffusion contributions resulting in identical and multi-exponential signal attenuation curves for isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting. The inset C depicts an example of material with a mixture of isotropic and anisotropic components resulting in multi-exponential signal decays for both isotropic and non- isotropic diffusion weighting, while the deviation between the attenuation curves for isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting provides a measure of anisotropy. Fig.2A-C show experimental results with analysis for different types of materials. Experimental results for isotropic (circles) and for non-isotropic (crosses) diffusion weighting are shown in all the insets. Experimental results and analysis are shown for a sample with free isotropic diffusion (inset A), for a sample with restricted isotropic diffusion (inset B) and for a sample with high degree of anisotropy (inset C). Fig. 3A and 3B show a Monte-Carlo error analysis for the investigation of systematic deviations and precision as a function of the range of diffusion weighting b for estimating the degree of micro-anisotropy with the disclosed analytical method. Background to the analysis method according to the present invention. Below there will be disclosed one possible method for isotropic diffusion weighting as a background to the analysis method according to the present invention. It is important to understand that this is only given as an example and as a background for the isotropic diffusion weighting. The analysis method according to the present invention is of course not limited to this route or method. Fact is that all possible diffusion weighting methods involving one part (gradient modulation scheme) for isotropic diffusion weighting and one other part for the non-isotropic diffusion weighting are possible starting points, and thus pre-performed methods, for the analysis method according to the present invention. Assuming that spin diffusion in a microscopically anisotropic system can locally be considered a Gaussian process and therefore fully described by the diffusion tensor D(r), the evolution of the complex transverse magnetization m(r,t) during a diffusion encoding experiment is given by the Bloch-Torrey equation. Note that the Bloch-Torrey equation applies for arbitrary diffusion encoding schemes, e.g. pulse gradient spin-echo (PGSE), pulse gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) and other modulated gradient spin- echo (MGSE) schemes. Assuming uniform spin density and neglecting relaxation, the magnetization evolution is given by \u25a0iyg(t)\u25a0 rm(r, t) + V \u02c7 [D(r ) \u02c7 Vm(r, \u03ae] , (1 ) where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and g(f) is the time dependent effective magnetic field gradient vector. The NMR signal is proportional to the macroscopic transverse ma netization If during the experiment each spin is confined to a domain characterized by a unique diffusion tensor D, the macroscopic magnetization is a superposition of contributions from all the domains with different D. Evolution of each macroscopic magnetization contribution can thus be obtained by solving Eqs. (1 , 2) with a constant and uniform D. The signal magnitude co where /0 is the signal without diffusion encoding, g=0, and q(f) is the time- dependent dephasing vector q(t) = Y]g(t')dt' = qF(t)q(t) , (4) defined for the interval 0\u0164E. The dephasing vector in Eqs. (3) and (4) is expressed in terms of its maximum magnitude q, the time-dependent normalized magnitude |F(f)|<1 and a time-dependent unit direction vector q(t) . Note that in spin-echo experiments, the effective gradient g(f) comprises the effect of gradient magnitude reversal after each odd 180\u00b0 radio frequency (RF) pulse in the sequence. Eq. (3) assumes that the condition for the echo formation q(fE) = 0 is fulfilled, which implies F(fE) = 0. In general there might be several echoes during an NMR pulse sequence. The echo magnitude (3) can be rewritten in terms of the diffusion weighting matrix, q2 ]F(t)2q(t)- qT(t)dt , (5) as l(tE ) = /\u0084 exp(- b : D) = 70 \u25a0 (6) Integral of the time-dependent waveform F(t)2 defines the effective diffusion time, id, for an arbitrary diffusion encoding scheme in a spin-echo experiment In the following we will demonstrate that even for a single echo sequence, gradient modulations g(f) can be designed to yield isotropic diffusion weighting, invariant under rotation of D, i.e. the echo attenuation is proportional to the isotropic mean diffusivity, D = tr(O) /3 = (Dxx + Dyy + D22)/3 . (8) In view of what is disclosed above, according to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the isotropic diffusion weighting is invariant under rotation of the diffusion tensor D. According to the present invention, one is looking for such forms of dephasing vectors F(t) q(t) , for which \u02dd _ jF(tfqT(t)- O- q(t)dt = tiD (9) o is invariant under rotation of D. If diffusion tenor D is expressed as a sum of its isotropic contribution, Dl , where I is the identity matrix, and the anisotropic contribution, i.e. the deviatoric tensor DA , so that D = Z>I + DA , the isotropic diffusion weighing is achieved when the condition jF(tfqT(t)- OA - q(t)dt = 0 (10) is fulfilled. In spherical coordinates, the unit vector q(t) is expressed by the inclination \u03b6 and azimuth angle y/ as 4 T (0 = ( qy ( qz (0} = {sin \u03b6 (t)cos \u03c8 (t), sin \u03b6 (t)sm \u03c8 (t), cos \u03b6 (\u03ae}. (1 1 ) The symmetry of the diffusion tensor, D = DT, gives qT D q = + qy 2Dyy + q2Dzz + 2qxqyDxy + 2qxqzDxz + 2qyqzD (12) or expressed in spherical coordinates as qr D q = sin2 \u03b6 cos2 y/D^ + sin^ 2 siny/\u017e + cos2 \u017e (13) + 2sin\u0141 cosy sin^ siny + 2sin^ cosy cos\u0141Dxz + 2sin^ siny/ \u03cb\u03bf\u03b5\u03b6\u0396) Equation (13) can be rearranged to The first term in Eq. (14) is the mean diffusivity, while the remaining terms are time-dependent through the angles \u03b6(\u0390) and y/(f) which define the direction of the dephasing vector (4). Furthermore, the second term in Eq. (14) is independent of \u03c8, while the third and the forth terms are harmonic functions of y/ and 2\u03c8, respectively (compare with Eq. (4) in [13]). To obtain isotropic diffusion weighting, expressed by Eq. (9), the corresponding integrals of the second, third and fourth terms in Eq. (14) must vanish. The condition for the second term of Eq. (14) to vanish upon integration leads to one possible solution for the angle\u0141(f), i.e. the time-independent \"magic angle\" (15) By taking into account constant \u0141m, the condition for the third and the fourth term in Eq. (14) to vanish upon integration is given by Conditions (16) can be rewritten in a more compact complex form as j>(t)2 exp[zly/(t)]t\u017e = 0 , (17) 0 which must be satisfied for / =1 , 2. By introducing the rate- (i) = F(tf , the integral (17) can be expressed with the new variable \u03c4 as j\"exp[z y/(r)]A: = 0. (18) 0 Note that the upper integration boundary moved from fE to fd- The condition (18) is satisfied when the period of the exponential is fd, thus a solution for the azimuth angle is for any integer n other than 0. The time dependence of the azimuth angle is finally given by y/(t) = y/(0)+\u0097 F(t')2dt' . (20) td 0 The isotropic diffusion weighting scheme is thus determined by the dephasing vector q(f) with a normalized magnitude F(t) and a continuous orientation sweep through the angles m (15) and \u03c8{\u03af) (20). Note that since the isotropic weighting is invariant upon rotation of D, orientation of the vector q(f) and thus also orientation of the effective gradient g(f) can be arbitrarily offset relative to the laboratory frame in order to best suit the particular experimental conditions. As understood from above, according to yet another specific embodiment, the isotropic diffusion weighting is achieved by a continuous sweep of the time-dependent dephasing vector q(f) where the azimuth angle y/(f) and the magnitude thereof is a continuous function of time so that the time-dependent dephasing vector q(f) spans an entire range of orientations parallel to a right circular conical surface and so that the orientation of the time-dependent dephasing vector q(f) at time 0 is identical to the orientation at time fE- Furthermore, according to yet another embodiment, the inclination \u03b6 is chosen to be a constant, time-independent value, i.e. the so called magic angle, such that \u03b6 = m = acos(l/V3\"). The orientation of the dephasing vector, in the Cartesian coordinate system during the diffusion weighting sequence, spans the entire range of orientations parallel to the right circular conical surface with the aperture of the cone of 2* m (double magic angle) and the orientation of the dephasing vector at time 0 is identical to the orientation of the dephasing vector at time tE, i.e. \u03c8(\u03af\u03b5) - \u03c8(0) = 2*\u03c0*\u03b7, where n is an integer (positive or negative, however not 0) and the absolute magnitude of the dephasing vector, q*F(f), is zero at time 0 and at time fE- The isotropic weighting can also be achieved by g-modulations with discrete steps in azimuth angle \u03c8, providing q(f) vector steps through at least four orientations with unique values of e\"'', such that \u03c8 modulus 2\u03c0 are equally spaced values. Choice of the consecutive order and duration of the time intervals during which \u03c8 is constant is arbitrary, provided that the magnitude F(t) is adjusted to meet the condition for isotropic weighing (10, 16). Specific implementations The pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) sequence with short pulses offers a simplest implementation of the isotropic weighting scheme according to the present invention. In PGSE, the short gradient pulses at times approximately 0 and fE cause the magnitude of the dephasing vector to instantaneously acquire its maximum value approximately at time 0 and vanish at time fE- The normalized magnitude is in this case given simply by F(t) = 1 in the interval 0 < f < fE and 0 otherwise, providing fd = fe- A simplest choice for the azimuth angle (20) is the one with n = 1 and \u03c8(0) = 0, thus The dephasing vector is given by The corresponding effective gradient, calculated from (23) \u03b3 at Here 5{t) is the Dirac delta function. Rotation around the y-axis by atan(V2) yields The effective gradient in Eqs. (24, 25) can conceptually be separated as the sum of two terms, The first term, 9PGSE, represents the effective gradient in a regular PGSE two pulse sequence, while the second term, giSo, might be called the \"iso-pulse\" since it is the effective gradient modulation which can be added to achieve isotropic weighting. As may be seen from above, according to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the method is performed in a single shot, in which the latter should be understood to imply a single MR excitation. The analysis method according to the present invention Below the analysis method according to the present invention will be discussed in detail. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a well-established measure of anisotropy in diffusion MRI. FA is expressed as an invariant of the diffusion tensor with eigenvalues , \u03bb2 and \u03bb\u03b6, In typical diffusion MRI experiments, only a voxel average anisotropy can be detected. The sub-voxel microscopic anisotropy is often averaged out by a random distribution of main diffusion axis. Here we introduce a novel parameter for quantifying microscopic anisotropy and show how it can be determined by diffusion NMR. Information about the degree of microscopic anisotropy can be obtained from comparison of the echo-attenuation curves, E(b) = 1(b)/ h, with and without the isotropic weighting. Multi-exponential echo attenuation is commonly observed in diffusion experiments. The multi exponential attenuation might be due to isotropic diffusion contributions, e.g. restricted diffusion with non-Gaussian diffusion, as well as due to the presence of multiple anisotropic domains with varying orientation of main diffusion axis. The inverse Laplace transform of E(b) provides a distribution of apparent diffusion coefficients P(D), with possibly overlapping isotropic and anisotropic contributions. However, in isotropically weighed diffusion experiments, the deviation from mono-exponential attenuation is expected to originate mainly from isotropic contributions. In practice, the diffusion weighting b is often limited to a low-Jb regime, where only an initial deviation from mono-exponential attenuation may be observed. Such behaviour may be quantified in terms of the kurtosis coefficient K (Jensen, J. H. , and Helpern, J. A. (2010). MRI quantification of non-Gaussian water diffusion by kurtosis analysis. NMR Biomed 23, 698- 710.), \\nE = -Db + -^b (28) The second term in Eq. (28) can be expressed by the second central moment of the distribution P(D). Provided that P(D) is normalized, the normalized echo signal is given by the Laplace transform E(b) = jp(D)e-bDdD . (30) The distribution P(D) is completely determined by the mean value and by the central moments The second central moment gives the variance, \u03bc2 = \u03c32, while the third central moment, \u03bc3, gives the skewness or asymmetry of the distribution P(D). On the other hand, the echo intensity can be expressed as a cumulant expansion (Frisken, B. (2001 ). Revisiting the method of cumulants for the analysis of dynamic light-scattering data. Appl Optics 40) by \\n E = -Db + ^b2 (33) 2 The first-order deviation from the mono-exponential decay is thus given by the variance of P(D). Assuming diffusion tensors with axial symmetry, i.e. = Dt and X2 = \u03c73 = DL , and an isotropic distribution of orientation of the tensor's main diffusion axis, the echo-signal E(b) and the corresponding distribution P(D) can be written in a simple form. In case of the single PGSE experiment, using a single diffusion encoding direction, the distribution is given by with the mean and variance, _ I1 + 2D, D \u0097 and (35) The echo-attenuation for the single PGSE is given by For a double PGSE with orthogonal encoding gradients, the distribution P(D) is given by with the same mean value as for the single PGSE but with a reduced variance, \u03bc2 (38) 45 As in the single PGSE, also in double PGSE the echo-attenuation exhibits multi-component decay, For randomly oriented anisotropic domains, the non-isotropic diffusion weighting results in a relatively broad distribution of diffusion coefficients, although reduced four-fold when measured with a double PGSE compared to the single PGSE. On the other hand the isotropic weighting results in with \u03bc2 = 0 (41 ) and a mono-exponential signal decay \u0141(*) : -bD (42) The variance \u03bc2 could be estimated by applying a function of the form (33) to fitting the echo attenuation data. However, in case of randomly oriented anisotropic domains, the convergence of the cumulant expansion of (36) is slow, thus several cumulants may be needed to adequately describe the echo attenuation (36). Alternatively, the distribution (34) may be approximated with the Gamma distribution \u03a1-\u00b0\u0399\u03b2 P(D) = Da-l \u0097 , (43) \u03a4(\u03b1)\u03b2\u03b1 ' where a is known as the shape parameter and \u03b2 is known as the scale parameter. For the Gamma distribution, the mean diffusivity is given by D = \u02c7 \u03b2 , while the variance is given by \u03bc2 = \u03b1 \u02c7 \u03b22. The Gamma distribution is an efficient fitting function. With the two parameters it can capture a wide range of diffusion distributions, with both isotropic as well as anisotropic contributions. Conveniently, the Laplace transform of the Gamma function takes a simple analytical form, E(b) = (l + b a = {\\ + b^ \u03bc\u03b9 . (44) The variance, \u03bc2'50, obtained by fitting the function (44) to the isotropic diffusion weighted echo-decay is related to the isotropic diffusion contributions, since the variance is expected to vanish with isotropic weighting in a pure microscopically anisotropic system (see Eq. 41 ). The same fitting procedure on non-isotropically weighted data will yield the variance \u03bc2 due to both isotropic and anisotropic contributions. The difference \u03bc2-\u03bc2 50 vanishes when all diffusion contributions are isotropic and therefore provides a measure of microscopic anisotropy. The mean diffusivity/J , on the other hand, is expected to be identical for both isotropically and non-isotropically weighted data. The difference \u03bc2-\u03bc2 50 is thus obtained by using the \u03bc2'50 and \u03bc2 as free fit parameters when Eq. (44) is fitted to isotropically and non- isotropically weighted data sets, respectively, while a common parameter D is used to fit both data sets. The difference \u03bc2-\u03bc250 along with D provide a novel measure for the microscopic fractional anisotro (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) as The \u03bc \u03a1 is defined so that the \u03bc \u03a1 values correspond to the values of the well-established FA when diffusion is locally purely anisotropic and determined by randomly oriented axially symmetric diffusion tensors with identical eigenvalues. Eq. (45) is obtained by setting \u03bc /\u039a = FA (27), assuming \u03bc2 - \u03bc2\u00b0 = \u03bc2 and expressing the eigenvalues D^ and D^ in terms of D and \u03bc2 {5\u03b2\u03b2 Eq. 35). In the case of a one-dimensional curvilinear diffusion, when \u0165 D\u0105 , \u03bc\u013d\u0391 = FA = 1 and in the case of two-dimensional curvilinear diffusion, when \u0141>\u0084 \u0164 D1 , \u03a1\u0391 = FA = 1/V2 . The difference \u03bc2-\u03bc2'\u03b40 in Eq. (45) ensures that the microscopic anisotropy can be quantified even when isotropic diffusion components are present. Isotropic restrictions, e.g. spherical cells, characterised by non- Gaussian restricted diffusion, are expected to cause a relative increase of both \u03bc2 and \u03bc2'50 by the same amount, thus providing the difference \u03bc2-\u03bc2'\u03b40 independent of the amount of isotropic contributions. The amount of non- Gaussian contributions could be quantified for example as the ratio For anisotropic diffusion with finite orientation dispersion, i.e. when local diffusion tensors are not completely randomly oriented, the D and \u03bc2- \u03bc2'50 are expected to depend on the gradient orientation in the non-isotropic diffusion weighting experiment. Furthermore, variation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), i.e. volume weighted average diffusivity, dependent on the gradient orientation and given by the initial echo decay of the non-isotropic diffusion weighting experiment, may indicate a finite orientation dispersion. Non-isotropic weighting experiment performed in several directions, similar to the diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis tensor measurements, performed with a range of b values to detect possibly multi- exponential decays, combined with the isotropic weighting experiment, is thus expected to yield additional information about microscopic anisotropy as well as information related to the orientation dispersion of anisotropic domains. Eq. (44) could be expanded by additional terms in cases where this is appropriate. For example, the effects of a distinct signal contribution by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in brain could be described by adding a mono- exponential term with the isotropic CSF diffusivity D to Eq. (44), where f is the fraction of the additional signal contribution. Eq. (46) could be used instead of Eq. (44) to fit the experimental data. A further explanation directed to inter alia \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 estimation and optimal range of the diffusion weighting b is given below in the section describing the figures in more detail. In relation to the description above and below it should be mentioned that also multi-echo variants of course are possible according to the present invention. Such may in some cases be benefitial for flow/motion compensation and for compensation of possible assymetry in gradient generating equipment. Specific embodiments of the present invention Below, specific embodiments of the analysis method according to the present invention will be disclosed. According to one specific embodiment, the method involves approximating the distribution of apparent diffusion coefficients by using a Gamma distribution and the signal attenuation by its inverse Laplace transform. This may increase the speed of the fitting procedure discussed below. The distribution of diffusion coefficients may contain isotropic and/or anisotropic contributions, it may arise due to a distribution of Gaussian diffusion contributions or it may be a consequence of a non-Gaussian nature of diffusion, e.g. restricted diffusion, or it may be due to orientation dispersion of anisotropic diffusion contributions (randomly oriented diffusion tensors) or it may be due to a combination of the above. One of the main advantages of the analysis method according to the present invention is that it can quantify degree of microscopic anisotropy with high precision from low b-range signal intensity data even in the presence of isotropic contributions, i.e. when they cause deviation from mono-exponential decay. Typically, isotropic contributions would bias the quantification of anisotropy from single PGSE attenuation curves, because multi-exponential signal decays due to isotropic contributions may look similar or indistinguishable to the ones caused by anisotropic contributions. The analysis according to the present invention allows to separate the influence of anisotropic diffusion contributions from the influence of isotropic diffusion contributions on the first order deviation from the mono-exponential decays, where the first order deviation may be referred to as diffusion kurtosis or the second central moment of diffusion distribution, and therefore allows for quantification of the degree of microscopic anisotropy. Therefore, according to the present invention, the method may involve using a fit function (44) comprising the parameters: initial value (I0 = ), initial slope (D ,i.e. the volume weighted average diffusivity or the mean diffusivity of a diffsuion tensor D ) and curvature, i.e. the second central moment of diffusion distribution (\u03bc2). See Eq. (44). Note that E(b) = I(b)/I0 . Therefore, according to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the two acquired echo attenuation curves (logE vs. b, where E is echo amplitude, which may be normalized, and b is the diffusion weighting factor) are compared in terms of initial value, initial slope or curvature, and/or the ratio between the two echo attenuation curves is determined, so that the degree of microscopic anisotropy may be determined. The method may involve fitting the isotropic and non-isotropic weighted data with the fit function (44) comprising the parameters: initial values (I0 ropic and non-isotropic data, initial slope (D i.e. the volume weighted average diffusivity or the mean diffusivity of a diffsuion tensor D ) with constraint that D values are identical for both isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighted data and the second central moments, \u03bc^0 and \u03bc2 \u03af\u03b8\u0393 isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighted data, respectively. The microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) is then calculated from the mean diffusivity, D , and the second central moments of diffusion distribution, \u03bc^0 and \u03bc2 according to Eq. (45). As disclosed above, according to one embodiment a fit function comprising the parameters initial value, initial slope and curvature (zeroth, first, and second central moment of the probability distribution of diffusion coefficients), fraction of the additional diffusion contribution (f) and/or diffusivity of the additional contribution (D-i) (see discussion below) are used. When the extended fitting model described in Eq. (46) is applied, then the mean diffusivity, D , the additional diffusion contribution (f) and the diffusivity of the additional contribution (D-i) are constrained to be equal for the isotropic and the non- isotropic diffusion weighted data. Moreover, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) is calculated from mean diffusivity (D ) and difference in second central moments of diffusion distribution (\u03bc2 \u03b9\u03b40 and \u03bc2). The method may also involve fitting the isotropic and non-isotropic weighted data, where non-isotropic weighted data is acquired separately for several directions of the magnetic field gradients with the fit function (44) comprising the parameters: initial value (I0 = ), initial slope ,i.e. the volume weighted average diffusivity D generally depending on the gradient orientation) and curvature, i.e. the second central moment of diffusion distribution (\u03bc2). Different fit constraints may be applied to optimize the accuracy of the estimated fit parameters. For example, the, initial slope (D ), i.e. the volume weighted average diffusivity D estimated from the non-isotropic diffusion weighted data acquired with diffusion weighting in different directions, such to yield information required to construct the diffusion tensor, D, could be subjected to the constraint where the trace of the diffusion tensor (determined by non-isotropic diffusion weighting experiments) is identical to three times the mean diffusivity, D , obtained from the isotropic diffusion weighting data, i.e. tr(D) = 3D . In such a case, the microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) parameter could still be calculated according to Eq. (45), however, care need to be taken when interpreting results of such calculations. As an alternative to fitting the non- isotropic diffusion weighted data in different gradient directions, e.g. from diffusion tensor measurement, the signal intensities may be averaged across the gradient orientations. The resulting curve will approximate a sample having full orientation dispersion, since averaging under varying gradient orientations is identical to averaging under varying orientations of the object. Therefore, according to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the echo attenuation curves acquired with at least one of the gradient modulation scheme based on isotropic diffusion weighting and the gradient modulation scheme based on non-isotropic diffusion weighting are averaged across multiple encoding directions. The method may involve the use of additional terms in Eq. (44), such as Eq. (46), applied to the analysis described in the above paragraphs. Eq. (46) comprises two additional parameters, i.e. fraction of the additional diffusion contribution (f) and diffusivity of the additional contribution (D-i ). One such example may be the analysis of data from the human brain, where the additional term in Eq. (46) could be assigned to the signal from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The parameter D in Eq. (46) would in this case be assigned to the mean diffusivity in tissue while the parameter D would be assigned to the diffusivity of the CSF. The isotropic diffusion weighting could thus be used to obtain the mean diffusivity in the brain tissue without the contribution of the CSF. In addition, valuable information about anisotropy may be obtained from the ratio of the non-isotropically and the isotropically weighted signal or their logarithms. For example, the ratio of the non-isotropically and the isotropically weighted signals at intermediate Jb-values, might be used to estimate the difference between the radial (DL ) and the axial (\u0141> ) diffusivity in the human brain tissue due to the diffusion restriction effect by the axons. Extracting the information about microscopic anisotropy from the ratio of the signals might be advantageous, because the isotropic components with high diffusivity, e.g. due to the CSF, are suppressed at higher Jb-values. Such a signal ratio or any parameters derived from it might be used for generating parameter maps in MRI or for generating MR image contrast. It is interesting to note that the \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 parameter is complementary to the FA parameter, in the sense that \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 can be finite in cases when FA = 0, while, on the other hand, \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 tends to vanish when FA is maximized by anisotropy on the macroscopic scale. Such approach could be used to analyse microscopic anisotropy and orientation distribution in a similar way as the diffusion tensor and kurtosis tensor analysis is used. Compared to the kurtosis tensor analysis, here presented microscopic fractional anisotropy analysis is advantageous in that it can separate the isotropic diffusion components that may contribute to the values of kurtosis detected with the present methodology for kurtosis tensor measurements. The analysis method according to the present invention is applicable in many different situations. According to one embodiment, the method is performed so that mean diffusivity is constrained to be identical for both isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighted data. If Eq. (46) is employed, then parameters and Di are also constrained to be equal for isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighted data. Furthermore, according to another specific embodiment of the present invention, the echo attention curve acquired with the gradient modulation scheme based on isotropic diffusion is assumed to be monoexponential. This may be of interest for the sake of approximating the microscopic anisotropy. According to another embodiment, the method is performed so that a mean diffusivity for isotropic diffusion weighted data is allowed to be different from the mean diffusivity for non-isotropic diffusion weighted data. This latter case would be better in cases when the micro-domains do not have random orientations, i.e. orientation dispersion is not isotropic. In such cases the mean diffusivity depends on orientation of the non-isotropic weighting. The analysis method according to the present invention may involve different forms of experiments. In this sense it should be noted that the present analysis encompasses all diffusion weighting pulse sequences where one achieves isotropic diffusion weighting and the other with a non-isotropic diffusion weighting. According to the present invention, there are however some specific set-up alternatives that may be mentioned additionally. According to one specific embodiment, the isotropic diffusion weighting and the non-isotropic diffusion weighting is achieved by two different pulse gradient spin echos (PGSEs). According to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the gradient modulation scheme based on isotropic diffusion weighting comprises at least one harmonically modulated gradient, which removes curvature of logE vs. b originating from anisotropy. According to yet another embodiment, the method involves a single-PGSE yielding maximum curvature of logE vs. b for the non-isotropic diffusion weighting, and a single-PGSE augmented with sinusoidal isotropic gradients for the isotropic diffusion weighting. As discussed above and shown in figs. 1A-C and e.g. 2A-C, the analysis method according to the present invention may be performed on many different forms of materials and substances. According to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the method allows for determining the degree of anisotropy in systems with anisotropic and/or isotropic diffusion, such as in liquid crystals. This may be used to infer about the geometry of micro-domains. For example, the analysis may be used to identify cases of curvilinear diffusion in 1 D with highest microscopic anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391 =1 ) or in 2D when diffusion is restricted to domains with planar geometry (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391 =1/V2), and other intermediate cases between isotropic and 1 D diffusion. As may be understood, the present invention also encompasses use of an analysis method as disclosed above. According to one specific embodiment, the present invention provides use of the analysis method, for yielding an estimate of the microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) with a value for quantifying anisotropy on the microscopic scale. Furthermore, there is also provided the use of a method according to the present invention, wherein anyone of the parameters microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391), mean diffusivity (D ), ^\u03bc1 \u03b9 D , fraction of the additional diffusion contribution (/) and/or diffusivity of the additional contribution (D-i) or any other parameter(s) calculated from \u03bc2, \u03bc2\u03b9\u03b40 or mean diffusivity is used for generating parameter maps in MRI or for generating MR image contrast. Information about microscopic diffusivity may be obtained from the ratio of the non-isotropically and isotropically weighted signals or their logarithms and may be used in parameter maps in MRI or for generating MR image contrast. The difference between the radial and axial diffusivity may be extracted (see above), which is obtained from the ratio of the signals. Furthermore, intended is also the use of a method according to the present invention, wherein microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bc\u03a1\u0391) is used for characterizing tissue and/or diagnosing, such as for diagnosing a tumour disease or other brain or neurological disorders. Moreover, also as hinted above, the analysis method according to the present invention may also be coupled to a pre-performed method involving isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting. Detailed description of the drawings In fig. 1 A-C there is shown a schematic representation of signal decays vs. b for isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting for different types of materials. In fig. 1 the following is valid: A) Solid lines represent decays in a non-isotropic diffusion weighting experiment for 1 D and 2D curvilinear diffusion (e.g. diffusion in reversed hexagonal phase H2 (tubes) and in lamellar phase La (planes), respectively). Dashed lines are the corresponding decays with isotropic diffusion weighting. The initial decay (D ) is identical for the isotropic diffusion weighting as for the non-isotropic diffusion weighting. B) The decay for a system with 70% free isotropic diffusion and 30% restricted isotropic diffusion. In this case the isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting result in identical signal decays in the entire Jb-range. C) Decays for a system with 70% anisotropic diffusion (2D) and 30% restricted isotropic diffusion. Solid line corresponds to the non-isotropic diffusion weighting while the dashed line corresponds to the isotropic diffusion weighting. The initial decays are identical for the isotropic and for the non-isotropic diffusion weighting, while the deviation between the decays at higher b values reveals the degree of anisotropy. In relation to the analysis performed and the presented results it may also be mentioned that comparing the signal decays of the two acquired echo attenuation curves may involve analysis of the ratio and/or difference between the two acquired echo attenuation curves. In fig. 2A-C are shown experimental results with analysis of micro- anisotropy for different types of materials. Shown are normalized signal decays vs. bD for isotropic (circles) and non-isotropic (crosses) diffusion weighting. Solid lines represent optimal fits of Eq. (44) to the experimental data, with constraint of equal initial decays, D , (shown as dashed lines) for isotropic and non-isotropic weighted data. All experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C. In all experiments, signal intensities were obtained by integration of the water peak. A) free water; data from the isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting overlap and give rise to mono-exponential signal decays. The analysis gives D = 2.2x10\"9 m2/s and \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 = 0. B) Suspension of yeast cells from baker's yeast (Jastbolaget AB, Sweden) in tap water with restricted water diffusion; data from the isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting overlap and give rise to multi-exponential signal decays. The analysis gives D = 1 .4x10\"9 m2/s and \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 = 0. C) Diffusion of water in a liquid crystal material composed by the Pluronic surfactant E5P68E6 with very high microscopic anisotropy, corresponding to a reverse hexagonal phase; data from the isotropic and non-isotropic diffusion weighting diverge at higher b- values and give rise to multi-exponential signal decay in case of the non- isotropic diffusion weighting and mono-exponential signal decay in case of the isotropic diffusion weighting. The analysis gives D = 4.8x10\"10 m2/s and \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 = 1 .0. In fig. 3A and 3B, the results of the Monte-Carlo error analysis show systematic deviations and precision of the D (A) and \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 (B) parameters estimated for the 1 D (dots) and 2D (circles) curvilinear diffusion according to what has been disclosed above. The ratio of the estimated mean diffusivity to the exact values D _ labelled as DID (A) with the corresponding standard deviation values and the estimated \u03bc /\u039a values (B) with the corresponding standard deviations are shown as dots/circles and error bars, respectively, as a function of the maximum attenuation factor b^J) for signal to noise level of 30. For \u03bc /\u039a estimation, the optimal choice of the Jb-values is important. To investigate the optimal range of Jb-values, a Monte-Carlo error analysis depicted in figs. 3A and 3B has been performed. The echo-signal was generated as a function 16 equally spaced Jb-values between 0 and J-W for the cases of 1 D and 2D curvilinear diffusion with randomly oriented domains. The upper limit, \u0141>max, was varied and the attenuation factors bD~ were chosen to be identical for the 1 D and 2D case. The signal was subjected to the Rician noise with a constant signal to noise, SNR = 30, determined relative to the non-weighted signal. Isotropic and non-isotropic weighed attenuation data were analyzed with the protocol described herein to obtain D and \u03bc /\u039a parameters. This analysis was repeated in 1000 iterations by adding different simulated noise signals with the given SNR. The procedure yields the mean and the standard deviation of the estimated D and \u03bc /\u039a, shown as dots/circles and error bars respectively in fig 3B. The optimal range of the diffusion weighting b is given by a compromise between accuracy and precision of the \u03bc /\u039a analysis and it depends on the mean diffusivity. If the maximum b value used is lower than MD , the \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 tends to be underestimated, while for maximum b values larger than MD the \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 tends to be overestimated. On the other hand the accuracy of \u03bc\u03a1\u0391 is compromised particularly at too low values of the maximum b, due to increased sensitivity to noise. See fig. 3B.",

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND The present invention is related to a magnetic field sensor, and more particularly to a mixed anisotropy magnetoresistive sensor. Sensors are generally known for measuring the magnitude of a magnetic field based on either giant magnetoresistive (GMR) or tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) materials. These materials are typically made up of two ferromagnetic thin films separated by a non-magnetic spacer. In most applications, one of the magnetic layers is \u0093pinned,\u0094 holding the orientation of the magnetization of that layer in a fixed direction. The other layer is free to rotate from an equilibrium direction, usually dictated by the coupling between layers as well as the shape in which the magnetic layers are patterned. The degree of deviation of the free layer is proportional to the amount of external field the sensor is exposed to, up to a saturation field (HS). The changes in relative orientations of the magnetizations of the pinned and free layers cause a corresponding change in the measured resistance when current flows through the sensor. FIG. 1 is a graph illustrating this resistance versus applied field curve, with layer orientations inset therein. If the non-magnetic spacer separating the ferromagnetic thin films is made of a conductive material, the sensor is a GMR sensor. If the non-magnetic spacer separating the ferromagnetic thin films is an insulating material, an added gain in magnetoresistance (MR) change is observed due to quantum mechanical tunneling of spin polarized current, and the sensor is a TMR sensor. SUMMARY The present invention is a mixed anisotropy magnetic field sensor. The sensor includes a first magnetic material film having in-plane anisotropy with a first magnetic easy axis that is in-plane, a second magnetic material film having out-of-plane anisotropy with a second magnetic easy axis that is perpendicular to the first magnetic easy axis of the first magnetic material film, and a non-magnetic spacer between the first magnetic material film and the second magnetic material film. The first magnetic material film has a magnetization oriented in a first magnetization orientation parallel to the first magnetic easy axis in the presence of no applied magnetic field, and the second magnetic material film has a magnetization oriented in a second magnetization orientation parallel to the second magnetic easy axis in the presence of no applied magnetic field. The magnetization of the first magnetic material film rotates to align with the magnetization of the second magnetic material film in the second magnetization orientation in the presence of an applied out-of-plane magnetic field exceeding a threshold, and the magnetization of the second magnetic material film rotates to align with the magnetization of the first magnetic material film in the first magnetization orientation in the presence of an applied in-plane magnetic field exceeding a threshold.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A magnetic field sensor is disclosed herein for measuring the magnitude of magnetic fields potentially in excess of 30 kiloOerstads (kOe) with a linear, non-hysteretic response above approximately 1 kOe. The sensor may be based on either GMR or TMR effects. Combined with one or more low field sensors, possibly on the same die, the linear detection range of a magnetic field sensor can be extended and used for multiple purposes. For example, the low field sensor could be used for compassing while the high field sensor could be used to provide a warning if a high intensity magnetic field is encountered. Magnetic multilayer films have been constructed and used for sensing of high magnitude magnetic fields, and also as the magnetic media for hard disk drives. In films of this type, the role of the layers involved is different than in a typical GMR or TMR device. The free (magnetically soft) layer of the film is strongly coupled to the pinned (magnetically hard) layer by ferromagnetic exchange coupling. When an electromagnetic is passed over the film, the soft layer assists in switching the hard layer. This can be referred to as a \u0093pseudo spin-valve\u0094 configuration, since the interlayer coupling of the film affects its switching behavior. In data storage applications, the orientation of the pinned (magnetically hard) layer defines a bit as a \u00910\u0092 or a \u00911\u0092. The magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer also defines how long a bit may be reliably stored. The field required to orient the magnetization of the pinned layer of a multilayer film of this type is generally quite high, such as greater than about 20 kOe for well tailored Co/TM (TM (transition metal)=Pt, Pd, Au) materials, and possibly even greater than about 100 kOe for FePtLlo materials. FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating an in-plane major hysteresis loop for a Co/Pd multilayer film that shows the in-plane saturation field at about 25 kOe. In order to orient the magnetization of the magnetic material layers of the film out-of-plane (OOP), an applied magnetic field must be sufficiently large to overcome the shape anisotropy of the film. The shape anisotropy arises from the magnetostatic energy being minimized in-plane. The shape anisotropy field (the field required to overcome shape effects) is determined by the demagnetization factor (4*\u03c0 for the case of a thin film) multiplied by the film's saturation magnetization (Ms): H k=4\u03c0M s\u2003\u2003(Equation 1) The typical Ms ranges between 700 emu/cm3 (kA/m) and 1500 emu/cm3 (kA/m), yielding a shape anisotropy field magnitude Hk between 1.9 kG and 8.8 kG for an in-plane material. FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating out-of-plane hysteresis loops for an in-plane film. A magnetic multilayer film may also be configured with perpendicular (out-of-plane) magnetic anisotropy. This means that the energetically favorable condition is for the magnetization direction (the magnetic easy axis) to point normal to the layers of the film. A perpendicular (out-of-plane) film provides a response to out-of-plane applied magnetic fields that is similar to the response of an in-plane film to in-plane applied magnetic fields, and provides a response to in-plane applied magnetic fields that is similar to the response of an in-plane film to out-of-plane applied magnetic fields. An interesting aspect of in-plane and perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy films is that the magnetization reversal is typically highly reversible and monotonic except at very low fields (e.g., <1 kG) when a field is applied along the magnetically \u0093hard\u0094 axis. Therefore, mating an in-plane film with a perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film in a GMR/TMR film stack can provide a means of measuring high magnitude applied films in nearly any direction. The highest field detectable can be tailored by varying the material growth conditions and is limited by the anisotropy field of each magnetic layer. FIG. 4A is a diagram illustrating the magnetization configuration for mixed anisotropy MR sensor 50 with no applied field (box 52), with an in-plane field applied (boxes 54 a and 54 b), and with an out-of-plane field applied (boxes 56 a and 56 b). As shown in box 52, sensor 50 includes in-plane anisotropy film F1 and perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film F2 separated by non-magnetic spacer layer NMS. An in-plane applied magnetic field causes the magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film F2 of sensor 50 to shift to an in-plane magnetization (as illustrated by a transition phase in box 54 a and a final phase in box 54 b) that is parallel to the magnetization of in-plane anisotropy film F1, and an out-of-plane applied magnetic field causes the magnetization of in-plane anisotropy film F1 of sensor 50 to shift to an out-of-plane magnetization (as illustrated by a transition phase in box 56 a and a final phase in box 56 b) that is parallel to the magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film F2. FIG. 4B is a graph illustrating the resulting resistance versus applied field curves of sensor 50. Curve 58 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an in-plane applied field, and curve 59 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an out-of-plane applied field. As can be seen in FIG. 5B, the response of sensor 50 is similar regardless of the field direction, with a linear response region between about 1 kOe and about 10 kOe. This allows sensor 50 to provide a response (a change in resistance) for any direction of applied field, which can be desirable in applications where the field may be applied in any direction with respect to the sensor, such as when the sensor is located in an implanted medical device, for example. FIG. 5 is a diagram of an exemplary detailed layer configuration of mixed anisotropy MR sensor 60. Similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 4A, sensor 60 is shown in FIG. 5 as including in-plane anisotropy film 62, perpendicular (out-of-plane) anisotropy film 64, and non-magnetic spacer layer 66. Non-magnetic spacer layer 66 may be a conducting material (for a GMR sensor) or an insulating material (for a TMR sensor). In-plane anisotropy film 62 includes main in-plane film 62 a and interface layer 62 b, and perpendicular anisotropy film 64 includes main perpendicular film 64 a and interface layer 64 b. Interface layers 62 b and 64 b represent regions where the magnetization, and possibly the film uniformity, are increased compared to main films 62 a and 64 a. This tends to improve the scattering of spin polarized current. The out-of-plane anisotropy energy of in-plane anisotropy film 62 is less than 2\u03c0Ms1 2t1, where Ms1 is the saturation magnetization and t1 is the thickness of in-plane anisotropy film 62. The out-of-plane saturation field is defined by NMs1, where N is the shape dependent demagnetization factor. N is equal to 4\u03c0 unless the lateral dimensions of the film are comparable to the thin film thickness. For sensor 60 to operate correctly, the out-of-plane saturation field is greater than the largest desired detectable field. The out-of-plane anisotropy of perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is greater than 2\u03c0Ms2 2t2, where Ms2 is the saturation magnetization and t2 is the thickness of perpendicular anisotropy film 64. For sensor 60 to operate correctly, the out-of-plane saturation field is smaller than the lowest desired magnetic field to be detected when that field is oriented normal to the film plane of sensor 60, and the in-plane saturation magnetization of perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is greater than the largest desired magnetic field vector component to be detected in-plane. In an exemplary embodiment, perpendicular anisotropy film 64 is comprised of [Co/TM]N (where TM=Pd, Pt, Au) multilayers with N repeats of the base bi-layer, FePt or a CrPtMn alloy layer. In an exemplary embodiment, in-plane anisotropy film is comprised of a film such as a [Co/Ni]N multilayer with N repeats of the bilayer or a more traditional MR layer such as a CoFeB/CoFe/NiCoFe trilayer. Non-magnetic spacer layer 66 could consist of Cu for GMR devices or AlO or MgO for TMR devices. In some embodiments, in-plane anisotropy film 66 and/or perpendicular anisotropy film 64 may be constructed with multiple magnetic and non-magnetic layers. In some embodiments, in-plane anisotropy film 62 and/or perpendicular anisotropy film 64 has increased magnetization (magnetic moment) in a region near non-magnetic spacer layer 66. FIG. 6 is a diagram of an alternative exemplary detailed layer configuration of mixed anisotropy MR sensor 160. Sensor 160 is similar to sensor 60 shown in FIG. 5, except that multiple films are stacked in the sensor to potentially improve sensor performance by amplifying the response of the sensor and/or tuning the resistance provided by the sensor. In the configuration shown in FIG. 6, sensor 160 includes a stack of films on substrate 161 that includes perpendicular anisotropy film 162, non-magnetic spacer 164, in-plane anisotropy film 166, non-magnetic spacer 168, perpendicular anisotropy film 170, non-magnetic spacer 172, and in-plane anisotropy film 174. Additional films may be added to sensor 160 as well, in the same pattern. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, perpendicular anisotropy film 162 includes main perpendicular film 162 a and interface layer 162 b. In-plane anisotropy film 166 includes interface layer 166 a, main in-plane film 166 b, and interface layer 166 c. Perpendicular anisotropy film 170 includes interface layer 170 a, main perpendicular film 170 b, and interface layer 170 c. In-plane anisotropy film 174 includes interface layer 174 a and main in-plane film 174 b. In addition to providing a measurement of the magnitude of applied magnetic fields, the sensors disclosed herein can provide a measurement of field direction. FIG. 7 is a graph illustrating magnetoresistance versus applied magnetic field for various tilt angles with respect to the normal of the sensor films. The curves shown in FIG. 7 show the magnetization switching behavior of a sensor for magnetic fields applied azimuthally from the film normal at 0\u00b0 (curve 180), 22.5\u00b0 (curve 182), 45\u00b0 (curve 184), 67.5\u00b0 (curve 186) and 90\u00b0 (curve 188). The device resistance varies between a minimum resistance (RMinimum) which occurs when the two film layers' magnetizations are parallel to each other, and a maximum resistance when the magnetizations are anti-parallel. This resistance can be expressed as: R=R Minimum[1+MR cos2({circumflex over (M)} FM1 \u2212{circumflex over (M)} FM2)]\u2003\u2003(Equation 2) where {circumflex over (M)}FM1\u2212{circumflex over (M)}FM2 is the angle between the magnetizations of the first ferromagnetic film (FM1), which is an in-plane film, and the second ferromagnetic film (FM2), which is an out-of-plane film. MR is the fractional change in resistance when the resistance goes from RMinimum to Rmaximum. Variations in the magnetostatic energy due to different material properties in each of the layers results in the different relative switching behavior of each layer. The switching behavior for a uniformly reversing magnetic film is dictated by the shape and intrinsic anisotropy energies in three dimensions. This energy can be written as: E=\u2212M S [H x cos \u03b8 sin+H y sin \u03b8 sin+H z cos \u03b8]+N x M S 2 cos2 \u03b8 sin \u03c6+N y M S 2 sin2 \u03b8 sin \u03b8+4\u03c0M S 2 cos \u03b8+K U V sin2(cos\u22121({right arrow over (M)}\u02c7{right arrow over (K)}/MK))\u2003\u2003(Equation 3) In Equation 3, the first term is the Zeeman energy from the applied magnetic field, the next three terms are the energies related to the geometric patterning/shape of the material and the last term is due to the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the material. In general, for the high field sensor disclosed herein, the in-plane shape anisotropy terms will be significantly small for both layers (smaller than the sensitive range) and can be cancelled leaving: E=\u2212M S [H x cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6+H y sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6+H z cos \u03b8]+4\u03c0M S 2 cos \u03c6+K U V sin2(cos\u22121({right arrow over (M)}\u02c7{right arrow over (K)}/MK))\u2003\u2003(Equation 4) Thus, there is competition between the 4\u03c0MS 2 term which constitutes the out-of-plane shape anisotropy and the magnetocrystalline/intrinsic anisotropy term (KuV). For the FM1 type of film, Ku V will be in-plane and small compared to the out-of-plane shape anisotropy and can be considered negligible as well when a field is applied out of plane. The FM2 film layer has an out-of-plane component to KuV which is significantly higher than 4\u03c0MS 2, causing the film's magnetization to prefer to orient normal to the film plane. The different energy landscapes between FM1 and FM2 results in different sensor response as a function of angle with respect to the film normal. Thus, the standalone sensor can serve as an azimuthal angle sensor. FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a packaging configuration in which multiple high field MR sensors 200, 202 and 204 are packaged on frame 206 in order to improve and fully extend field sensitivity to three dimensions. The thin films of each of sensors 200, 202 and 204 are positioned with their magnetic easy axes oriented orthogonally to each other. This creates unique responses in each of the three sensor directions, and the superposition of these signals allows the magnitude and direction of any applied magnetic field to be measured. FIGS. 9A, 9B and 9C are diagrams illustrating examples of mixed anisotropy MR sensors constructed of magnetic multilayer films having interlayer coupling that affects switching. Film 220 a shown in FIG. 9A includes substrate 222 a, seed layer(s) 224 a, magnetically \u0093hard\u0094 Co/Pd pinned multilayer 226, ultrathin Ni layer 228, ultrathin Co layer 229, Cu spacer layer 230, CoFe layer 231, magnetically \u0093soft\u0094 NiFe free layer 232, CoFe layer 233, Cu spacer layer 234, ultrathin Co layer 235, ultrathin Ni layer 236, magnetically \u0093hard\u0094 Co/Pd pinned multilayer 238, and capping layer(s) 239 a. Layers 226, 228 and 229 are part of a first out-of-plane film, and layers 235, 236 and 238 are part of a second out-of-plane film. Within these films, layers 226 and 238 are the main film layers, and layers 228, 229, 235 and 236 are the interface layers (referring to the terminology introduced in the description of FIGS. 5 and 6 above). Layers 231, 232 and 233 are part of an in-plane film, with layer 232 being the main film layer and layers 231 and 233 being the interface layers. In this configuration, free layer 232 is strongly coupled to pinned layer 226 (and/or to pinned layer 238) by ferromagnetic exchange coupling. In the presence of a magnetic field, free layer 232 assists in switching the magnetization of pinned layer 226 (and/or pinned layer 238). Film 220 b shown in FIG. 9B includes substrate 222 b, seed layer(s) 224 b, thin Co layer 240, Cu spacer layer 242, thicker Co layer 243, Cu spacer layer 244, thin Co layer 245, Cu spacer layer 246, thicker Co layer 247, Cu spacer layer 248, thin Co layer 249, and capping layer(s) 239 b. In this configuration, thicker Co layers 243 and 247 provide films with an in-plane preferred magnetization direction (magnetic easy axis), while thin Co layers 240, 245 and 249 provide films with an out-of-plane preferred magnetization direction (magnetic easy axis), by virtue of the interface anisotropy of the thin Co layers. Film 220 c shown in FIG. 9C includes substrate 222 c, seed layer(s) 224 c, thin Co layer 250, Cu spacer layer 252, thin Co layer 254, Cu spacer layer 256, thin Co layer 258, Cu spacer layer 260, thin Co layer 262, and capping layer(s) 239 c. Film 220 c is constructed similarly to film 220 b shown in FIG. 9B and described above, in that the material stack is constructed from a Co/Cu multilayer. However, film 220 c is made up of Co layers (layers 250, 254, 258 and 262) that all have the same thickness, and which are thin (less than 0.5 nanometers (nm), about 0.3 nm in an exemplary embodiment). This configuration produces a sensor with essentially omnidirectional high field sensitivity. The small thickness of the Co layers likely result in lateral decoupling of the Co layers, because not enough growth has occurred for continuous layers to form. The significantly reduces the impact of the shape anisotropy, while preserving the large interface anisotropy of the Co layers. As a result, the response of each layer is essentially omnidirectional, with the anti-ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Co layers with no applied field, and the layers' gradual ferromagnetic alignment as larger fields are applied, providing this omnidirectional response. FIG. 10A is a graph illustrating resistance versus applied field curves of sensor film 220 a. Curve 270 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an in-plane applied magnetic field, and curve 272 is the resistance versus applied field curve for an out-of-plane applied magnetic field. As can be seen in FIG. 10A, the response of sensor film 220 a is similar for both the in-plane and out-of-plane applied magnetic fields, with a linear response region between about 1 kOe and about 10kOe (similar to the expected/modeled response shown in FIG. 5B). FIG. 10B is a graph illustrating resistance versus applied field curves of sensor film 220 c. Curve 280 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 0\u00b0 from the normal of film 220 c, curve 282 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 45\u00b0 from the normal of film 220 c, and curve 284 illustrates the resistance versus applied field for a magnetic field applied 90\u00b0 from the normal of film 220 c. As can be seen in FIG. 10B, the response of the sensor to all of these fields is very nearly the same, showing the omnidirecitonal performance of the sensor. In an exemplary application, a temperature compensating scheme is employed to ensure device stability over a range of temperatures. This may take the form of a Wheatstone bridge where, in low-field sensors, two of the bridge legs are shielded from magnetic fields to provide a common reference. Shielding in this manner is not practical for high-field applications, as the shielding material will saturate in the large fields and provide no immunity to the reference sensor. For the high-field sensors disclosed herein, the symmetry between the in-plane and out-of-plane layers provides a solution to this problem. The sensors disclosed herein consume relatively low power in comparison to Hall effect sensors, similar to high sensitivity GMR and TMR sensors, and can be manufactured using the same processes as those sensors. It some embodiments, it is possible to have an array of sensors that operate in different ranges on the same die. The sensors disclosed herein are able to provide a linear response to magnetic fields in a certain range of field magnitudes. For example, the sensor response shown in FIG. 10A shows an in-plane linear response to fields between about 0.5 kilo-Oerstads (kOe) and about 3.5 kOe, and an out-of-plane linear response to fields between about 2 kOe and about 9 kOe. The sensor response shown in FIG. 10B shows a robust, essentially omnidirectional linear response to fields between about 1 kOe and at least about 10 kOe. Thus, one characterization of embodiments of the sensors disclosed herein may be that they provide a linear response to magnetic fields in a range of at least about 3 kOe within a window of field magnitudes between about 0.5 kOe and about 10 kOe. Another characterization of certain embodiments of the sensors disclosed herein may be that they provide a linear response to magnetic fields between about 1 kOe and about 10 kOe. Other characterizations may be made as well, based on the description of exemplary embodiments provided herein. One example of an application of the sensors disclosed herein is in the medical device industry. Many of the devices used to treat chronic ailments such as heart disease and hearing loss (pacemakers and hearing aids, respectively) possess microelectronics that are highly sensitive to high magnetic fields. This creates a problem, particularly in surgically implanted devices, when a high field is encountered. An example of this is if a patient with a pacemaker needs an MRI, or is in a facility with high field equipment. The sensor disclosed herein would allow for detection of the field and the device could be placed in a \u0093safe\u0094 mode before damage to the device or to the patient would occur. Other exemplary applications include a low cost detector for experimental and test equipment setups, or field detection in an environment with significant radiation (e.g. space or nuclear plants) due to the radiation hardness of the sensor. There are likely also numerous applications in the defense, security and manufacturing industries where high fields are often present and can be indicators of events such as machine actuation, launches or attempted unauthorized access. The above description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention occasionally refers to dimensions. It should be understood that references to dimensions herein take normal processing variations into account, whether the term \u0093about\u0094 is used with the dimension or not, so that dimensions that vary from the particular dimensions described herein within such a processing variation are contemplated by the present disclosure. While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.

Strecker [57] ABSTRACT A method of determining dip, anisotropy, and true resistivity of an earth formation dipping relative to a well bore traversing it by inducing an electromagnetic field in the earth formation with an alternating current transmitting coil to cause electrical currents to flow in the ,earth formations to generate an e.m.f. in three detector coils spaced from the transmitting coil. The coils lie in mutually perpendicular planes, preferably with a common center point for their respective axes. By combining the signal from two of the'coils and taking the ratio of the square root of the sum of the squares of these signals to the signal in the other coil, an electrical quantity representative of the dip and anisotropy of the earth formation is generated. With a knowledge of dip of the formation from a conventional dipmeter log and said electrical quantities, the anisotropy (the square root of the ratio of vertical to horizontal resistivity of the formation) if any, can be identified. In the absence of other dip information, the electrical anisotropy and dip of the formation is identified by using said electrical quantities with a conven- :tional electric log of the non-inductive type. From such anisotropy, true vertical resistivity of the formation can be determined provided true horizontal resistivity is known, No knowledge of the strike of the formation relative to the borehole is required to measure either dip or anisotropy. 7 Claims, 10 Drawing Figures PATENTEOAPR30 m4 3.808.520 SHEET 2 BF 7 w H HT=TOTAL INDUCED g MAGNETIC FIELD-DUE m TO ONE CURRENT LOOP (I o m CURRENT FLow LOOP PRIMARY ELECTRIC FIELD ILI 1 .J Pv I CD ,0 /%H e=DIP ANGLE 15.1. .1 INvENToR RICHARD .1.

FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to electrical induction well logging. More particularly, it relates to a method of identifying dip and anisotropy of an earth formation independent of strike relative to a borehole traversing the formation by detecting the alternating current induced in receiver coils having three mutually perpendicular planes and resulting from distortion of the induced electrical current flow field by dip and anisotropy of an earth formation when an electromagnetic field is induced therein by an alternating current signal. The detected currents are recorded as an indication of such dip and anisotropy of the formation. Resolution of anisotropy, dip, and true vertical 'andhorizontalresistivity is obtained by combination of such recorded currents with conventional non-inductive electrical induction, electrical and dip meter logs. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to fully identify the dip, anisotropy, true horizontal resistivity, and true vertical resistivity (horizontal and vertical being defined in terms of the direction of the borehole axis) from passive electrical measurements made in accordance with this invention by an arrangement of passive receiving coils having mutually perpendicular axes and a substantially common center point relative to and spaced apart froma passive induction electric transmitting coil. The electrical signals so generated are then combined with electrical measurements or other known data regarding the earth formation to fully define the earth formatiorrs electrical, and inferentially physical, characteristics with respect to dip and anisotropic properties; such properties are directly related to the true vertical and true horizontal resistivities. While resolution of dip and anisotropy of any bed is a matter of interest to petroleum engineers and oil explorers, these characteristics are particularly useful in' understanding and analyzing the type of measurements described in my'issued U. S. Pat. No. 3,256,480. As disclosed in that patent, a knowledge of the earths vertical resistivity is sometimes important in detecting the presence or absence of a'resistivity anomaly, such as a salt dome, lying at some distance from a well bore. There is also disclosed in my application, Ser. No. 662,981, filed Aug. 24, 1967, a method of measuring the vertical resistivity of a geological column extending over a given length, and sometimes bridging several parallel earth formations cut by a well bore. As disclosed in that application, the true vertical resistivity measured over such a macroscopic-sample, relative to the borehole, is also the vertical anisotropy (perpendicular to bedding planes). As distinguished from my previously filed application and the issued patent, the present method is directed to identification of anisotropy of an earth formation that is dipping relative'to the well bore, or where the earth formation is non-isotropic in electric conductivity (anisotropy) such as shale formations, or dirty sand formations, as well as limestone formations. Such formations have tortuous paths (or conductivity) that are different along the bedding plane as compared to those across the bedding plane. The present invention is directed to a method of identifying this across the bed anisotropy and dip of such an anisotropic earth formation.- In a preferred form of apparatus for carrying out the method, three induction receiving coils are positioned to intersect at substantially a common center and at a point vertically displaced from an induction transmitter coil whose plane ishorizontally oriented. The transmitted coil is energized at a frequency from a few kilocycles to a few hundred kilocycles, to establish in the earth formation an alternating electromagnetic field which has an associated alternating electrical current field that is distorted by the anisotropic character and conductivity of an earth formation traversed by the well bore and subjected to such radiation. By measurement of the voltages or currents induced in the three coils and a knowledge of either the dip of the earth formations traversing the well bore from a dip meter or a conventional non-inductive E-log, representing resistivity or conductivity of the earth formations, it is possible, in accordance with the teaching of the present specification, to identify completely the anisotropy, dip, and cross-bed, or true vertical, resistivity of the formation. In addition, the true horizontal resistivity can be obtained via these measurements. In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, and with a knowledge of direction of the transmitter and receiver coils with respect to magnetic North or any known direction mark, a true strike measurement of the earth formation relative to a well bore can be indicated. PRIOR ART cult so that they are not widely used. It is considered quite undesirable to use motor driven equipment in a logging instrument because both power needs and heat generated in a tool intended to operate as deep as 15,000 feet at temperatures up to 300F and external pressures of up to 7,500 psi. For this reason there has been a long standing need for a system that will determine anisotropy and dip of an earth formation with passive electrical detecting elements and conventional electrical well log information, as disclosed herein. Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description read with the accompanying drawings that form a part of this application. FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a borehole induction electric logging system suitable for carrying out the method of this invention by detecting induced electromagnetic currents in dipping earth formations, including a surface recording system indicating and recording such currents. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view through the logging tool in the direction of arrows 22, illustrating a preferred coil construction. FIG. 3 is an isometric representation of anearth formation in which the bedding dips relative to the axis of the borehole, useful in explaining the invention. FIG. 4 is a diagram of electrical field and magnetic field vectors generated and induced by the coil arrangement in the tool shown in FIG. 1, as such vectors are influenced by anisotropic media dipping relative to the axes of the generated field. FIG. 5 is a data flow diagram of an arrangement to use the induced electrical currents measured in accordance with the apparatus of FIG. 1 with information from a dip meter log of the same depth interval to generate a representation of the electrical anisotropy of an earth formation traversed by the borehole. FIG. 6 is a flow diagram ofa system to use the recorded electrical signals from apparatus of FIG. 1 to indicate strike of anisotropic, dipping beds. FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of a system to calculate and record true, or dip-corrected, resistivity from the recorded electrical signals from the apparatus of FIG. 1 and an uncorrected resistivity trace of the same depth interval obtained from a conventional induction log. FIGS. 8 and 9 together form a flow diagram of a system to calculate and record true vertical resistivity, true horizontal resistivity, dip and anisotropy of earth formation traversed by a borehole from the recorded electrical signals from apparatus according to FIG. 1 and an apparent resistivity log from a conventional non-inductive E-log without use of a dipmeter log. In the figure, l Gs is the magnitude of the geometric factor of the R coil. FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of the calculations performed by Unit Q-in FIG. 8. Referring now to the drawings and in particular FIG. 1, there is shown in schematic form an induction log ging system constructed to perform the method of the present invention. As particularly distinguished from conventional induction logging systems using one or two receiving coils, the present arrangement includes three coils designated as R Ry and R Preferably, I these coils have a common center point and the electrical axis of each coil is mutually perpendicular to the axes of the other two coils. The coils are, of course, positioned within a pressure resistant but non-conducting enclosure 10 forming the lower end of logging sonde 16. They are vertically spaced along the Z axis at a known distance from a transmitter coil, designated as T. As indicated schematically in the drawing, and better seen in FIG. 2, the coils have been designated by their axes of symmetry. For example, coil R has its axis parallel with the Z or vertical axis of sonde 16. Correspondingly, at 90 to that axis, both the axes of coils R and Ry are parallel to the X and Y axes, which arbitrarily are made mutually perpendicular to each other and to the Z axis. The R and the T coils are, of course, conventional to commercially operated electrical induction logs. The R and Ry coils are not. While not shown, it is of course understood that the uniformity of the field established by the T coil may be assisted by adjacent focusing coils. In operation of such an induction logging system it is necessary to supply an alternating current to transmitter coil T at a frequency of a few hundred Hz to 50 KHz to generate an alternating current magnetic field in the adjacent formation, such as 12, which for the purposes of the present explanation is indicated as dipping by an angle 0 with respect to the Z axis. Source T is driven by oscillator 14. Power is supplied to oscillator 14 through the supporting well logging cable 18 and slip ring assembly 22 by source 20, located at the earth's surface. Multiconductor cable 18 also transmits signals from each of the three receiving coils R Ry, R after amplification respectively in amplifiers 24, 26 and 28. These amplifiers are also located in sonde 16, and like the power oscillator 14 are preferably within the pressure resistant housing portion, such as steel section 30. Steel section 30 also serves as a common ground connection through wire 32 for all of the transmitting and receiving coils. Each of the three receiving coils detects any components of the induced electromagnetic field that generate electrical currents therein. These currents are then recorded either optically, as on oscillograph paper 32, or magnetically for further processing in accordance with the present invention, on magnetic tape 34. In each case, the current from the three individual receiving coils in first sent through a detector 36, 38, and 40, respectively, to generate a value indicated as output I Iy and 1 These outputs run to galvanometers 42 to record visually on oscillograph paper 32, or are recorded as magnetic signals by heads 44 on magnetic tape recorder 34. Reference depth of logging sonde 16 in well bore 11 is through cable depth measuring unit 46 which directly drives paper chart 32, or a signal marker 48 on magnetic tape 34. Drive for tapes recorder 34 may be independent of the drive of cable 18 through depth measuring unit 46. In such an arrangement, electric motor 49 drives tape 34 at a constant speed, with fiducial marks being made by marker 48 at the correct position relative to signals I Iy and I Reference is now made to FIGS. 3 and 4 to explain the method of the present invention for using apparatus of FIG. 1 to determine electrical anisotropy, dip, strike and true vertical or horizontal resistivity of earth formations cut by the well bore. As best seen in FIG. 3, the borehole axis is labeled as lying along a vertical line designated as Z. As indicated, the dipping beds, or bedding planes, of earth formations cut by the borehole are taken as being tilted about the X, Y axis so that its axis Z is normal (vertical) to the bedding planes and is displaced from the Z axis by an angle 0. The bedding planes are then parallel to both the X, X axis and tilted axis Y. 6 is the dip angle. By definition the anisotropy of the bedding is designated as A, and is the square root of the ratio of the vertical resistivity (p divided by the horizontal resistivity (p In sedimentary earth formations the resistivity perpendicular to the bedding planes is almost always greater (and conductivity less) than the horizontal resistivity unless the formation is isotropically uniform, such as an unbedded sand or a limestone, so that the way the beds were laid down by sedimentation did not produce a difference in the resistivity or conductivity across and along the bed. FIG. 4 indicates the influence of a tilted bed, of the type shown in FIG. 3, on a primary electric field generated by a point source, such as transmitter coil T, in a homogeneous medium, or a non-dipping bed. The current flow loop and the primary electric field are coincident in such a medium; but, in an earth formation having anisotropy and dip, the current flow loop is tiled as indicated in the diagram. FIG. 4 shows transmitter coil T with its axis parallel to the borehole and the three triplet receiver coils, R Ry and R with centers at the center of the borehole. An oscillatory current in transmitter coil T produces an oscillatory electric field in the medium as shown i n FIG. 4, where the electric field vectors (indicated as E) are tangent to circles whose planes are perpendicular to the. borehole. Shownalso is a loop of current induced for the case in which the axis of anisotropy is is anisotropic, and in particular when the conductivity tensor has off-diagonal elements, then in general, the current density vector will not be parallel to the electric field vector. Such a situation actually exists in the case of a dipping anisotropic medium where the axis of anisotropy makes an arbitrary angle with respect to the borehole. In FIG. 4, one sees immediately that the total magnetic field I-I induced by such tilted current loops at the transmitter coils T makes an angle with respect to the borehole axis and is no longer parallel to the borehole. Thus, vertical coils R and Ry, as well as coil R can have components of the magnetic field perpendicular to the planes of these coils. In other words, the , possibility now exists'for all three coils to be able to pick up a signal from the fluctuating magnetic field. When there is no dip, 0, then the situation returns to the conventional one even though there is anisotropy. In other words, in this case the total magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of coil R but is parallel to the plane of coils R and Ry. When there is no anisotropy, then the current loop follows the tangentialelectric field of the transmitter and is in a plane perpendicular to the borehole. In this case only horizontal coil R sees a fluctuating magnetic field component perpendicular to its plane. It is a detection of the quadrature voltages in R and Ry by the total induced magnetic field H which are used in accordance with they present invention to determine the dip or anisotropy and other quantities discussed below. ANISOTROPY FROM I Iy AND 1 AND DIP ANGLE 0 FROM DIPMETER The arrangement of FIG. 5 indicates a system for computing from the information derived from apparatus such as that shown in FIG. 1 the anisotropyof an earth formation when there is available information concerning the dip angle of the formation. Normally, such dip angle may be known from a conventional dip meter log, and apparatus in accordance with FIG. 5 makes use of the three signals obtained from the R Ry, and R coils and the dip angle 0 at the same depth interval to calculate the value of A, the anisotropy. FIG. 5 apparatus is arranged to compute the formula: where 0 dip angle and, From this formula, )t is calculated automatically by the arrangement of FIG. 5 which uses as input the currents I ly and I and the dip meter reading 0. These inputs are indicated schematically and are understood to be derived from a magnetic tape such as that shown in FIG. 1, where the three values of the coils are simultaneously applied to the input lines 50, 51, and 52. The input of the value 6, the dip at the same depth, is read from a reading head 53 on dip meter chart, designated 54 coupled to sine, cosine converters, designated 55 and 56, respectively. The signal I X and Iy from lines 50 and 51, respectively, from the R coil and the Ry coils are square by units 57 and 58 and applied to an adder 59 to give the quantity l I This value is then converted through a square root device 60 to produce the I (preferably a rectifier) 47. The ratio of L; to I1 I generate the quantity m in unit 61. In the numerator of the above-noted equation, m is to be combined with sin 0 from unit 55. This is done in multiplier 62. m sin 0 is then combined with cos 6 by adder 63 so that the combined value can be multiplied by sin 0 in multiplier 64. The output of multiplier 64 forms the numerator, sin 0(m sin 0 cos 0). This value is fed to ratio device 65 where it is to be divided by the denominator to produce the value A Extraction of the square root of A is through square root device 66 so that the value A can be written, either in' graphic form, or as a magnetic signal, on output tape 67 by writing head 74. The denominator of the above equation is generated by combining sin 0 and cos 0 in multiplier 68 whose inputsare direct from cosine unit 56 and sine unit 55. The remainder of the denominator is generated by first squaring cos 0 in unit 69 and then combining cos 6 with the unit value, 1, in adder 70, whose input is from squarer 69 and constant value 1, indicated as being generated by a battery 71. The'output of added 70 is then 1 cos 0, which is then multiplied in unit 72 by m, derived from ratio unit 61. The output of multiplier 72 and 68 are then combined in subtractor 73 to produce the final value of the denominator, namely, sin0cos0m( l cos 0) supplied to ratio device 65. One check of the validity of the foregoing equation can be seen by the assumption of zero dip; under such conditions the flow of current in coils I and Iy will be essentially zero so that the value m also becomes zero, and the measured value of A is 1, also indicating that horizontal and vertical resistivity, or conductivity, are equal. The formation derived'from the tool shown in FIG. 1 may also be used to indicate directly strike of formations cut by the borehole. This information is developed directly from current flow in the coils R and Ry and recorded as current values I and I As indicated in FIG. 6, these two values are compared through a ratio measuring device 75. The ratio output l /Iy is the tangent of angle y, indicated as the strike angle. This value may be either directly recorded on tape 76 by head 77, or the angle directly written by conversion of the tangent 'y by an arctangent converter 78 to write the value of 'y directly on tape 79 by head 80. In present nomenclature, the value of the angle is taken as perpendicular to the well bore, or Z, axis and parallel to the XY plane, with angle 7 being defined as a departure from a known marker such as true north. The XY plane is assumed to be parallel to the earths surface so that the angle y between the strike and true north is represented as the direction at which a line on the earths surface and a bed dipping at angle 6 would intersect it. Otherwise stated, 'y is the angle between the plane of one or the other of the vertical coils R or Ry and the strike direction of the dipping earth formation traversed by the well bore. Instantaneous values recorded on strip chart 79 is, of course, in accordance with the depth of the recorded signals taken from the logging sonde as illustrated in FIG. 1. True Resistivity or Conductivity from FIG. and Conventional Induction Log Reference is now made to FIG. 7 in which there is illustrated a system for calculating and displaying the true resistivity of an earth formation, using information derived from the true anisotropy value as derived by the practice of the method illustrated by the arrangement of FIG. 5, including a dip meter measurement of dip angle 0 and a conventional induction log of the same depth interval. The values are calculated automatically through apparatus of FIG. 7 for calculating the formula: (o 0 I: 13 1 (A I) cos 0/2A By the above formula, the ratio of the true value pA for no dip to the apparent resistivity pA 9 as measured by the conventional induction log, with dip 0 present, is entirely a function of dip angle 0 and the anisotropy A as given by the above formula. FIG. 7 shows how to combine the values to produce the uncorrected resistivity p,,(0), as well as the true resistivity p,,(()), or alternatively, true conductivity. For completeness in description of FIG. 7, the value of the dip angle 0 is again illustrated as being derived from a dip meter record, such as tape 154 through reading head 153. However, in this arrangement, only the cosine 0 need be derived, and this can bedome by cosine converter device 156, which is then transmitted to a squarer such as 169 for combination with the value V-l in multiplier 82. A l is derived from the A value, indicated as the output of ratio device 65, in FIG. 5. This value is combined in adding circuit 83 with a 1 value derived from a constant current source such as battery 84. A is also multiplied in unit 86 by a constant 2, derived from battery 85, to generate the denominator 2A supplied to ratio device 87. The remainder of the numerator is supplied by feeding A to adder 88 where it is combined with constant voltage supplied by battery 89 to form the sum A l. The output of adder 88 and multiplier 82 are then combined in adder 90 to form the numerator A 2 l (A l) cos 0. By then reading through head 95 from chart 91, which contains the uncorrected induction log resistivity, and combining this value through multiplier 92, the true resistivity p,,(0) is written on dip corrected chart 93 by head 94. This trace is likewise recorded as a function of depth in synchronism with the input data obtained from dip meter 54, induction log resistivity record 91, and depth information for each value of). produced by the arrangement of FIG. 5. Anisotropy and Dip Angle 0, from I Iy and I and a Non-Inductive Electric Log FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 disclose a system for obtaining simultaneously dip angle 0 and anisotropy A from logging data recorded in accordance with the apparatus of FIG. 1, and a properly depth synchronized non-inductive conventional electrical log for the same depth interval under consideration. Such an arrangement permits these values to be determined at any depth without direct use or availability of a dip meter log. The present arrangement is obviously useful where there is a noninductive electric log available but no dip meter log for the same interval. In solution of this problem, certain measured quantities designated as r are equated to calculated quantities, p, until such time as the values of p and r are equal; at that time, the value required for equality is recorded as the output of the depth. These equations are as follows: In FIG. 8,.the measured quantity r is given as the magnitude of the signal l I; l coming from the R coil times the apparent resistivity p, (0) from the noninductive E-log divided by a geometrical quantity derived from the construction principles of our device; At the same time, the other required quantity, p, is computed by a circuit called Box Q, shown in detail in FIG. 9 which enters the other side of comparator 100. In order to compute p, we need a constantly varying dip angle 0 which is obtained from a sweep generator 101 sweeping voltage linearly from 0 to 1'r/2. Sweep generator 101 generates a varying 9 and feeds signals into sine and cosine generators, 102 and 103, respectively, and supplied to Box Q. In addition, another input to Box 0 is the quantity m. It is simply obtained as shown in FIG. 5 by taking the ratio of the quadrature signal Iq to the absolute magnitude of 1 m is independent of 0. The output of Box Q is the quantity p given by the formula, where F [m sin 6+ sin 0 cos O/sin 0 cos 0 m(l cos 0)] As 0 is increased by sweep generator 101, p is constantly computed in Box Q and fed into comparator r, which is variable with 0, is then compared with p and when the comparison of r and p is adequate, that is they are sufficiently equal to one another, a trigger signal is generated in comparator 100 and fed to sweep generator 101 shutting off the sweep and causing generator 101 via switch 104 to output the last value of 0 on tape 105 through head 106. This value of 0, which we call is the solution of thesystem for the dipand it represents the solution of the equation r p. This output also may be used as input to the arrangement of FIG. 10 where through further processing we generate A and the absolute values of vertical and horizontal resistivity. r The details of Box Q are shown in FIG. 9 and include a group of interconnected analog circuits to calculate the right hand side of the equation given above forp. The'input values a, b, c (to Box Q) of FIG. 8 are illustrated as the input at the top of FIG. 9. As discussed above, the input m is from FIG. 5 and is in fact the ratio of 1 to |I The inputs b and c as indicated, are the cosine and sine valuesof 0 produced by sweep generator 101 in FIG. 8. As a first operation these sine and cosine values are squared in units 145 and 146, respectively. The values are also multiplied together by multiplier 107. With these three inputs, cos 0, sin 0, and m, it is possible to produce the value p from the above noted equation. 4 To avoid repetition in the description, the e nation is defined for shorthand purposes as N X F/D. N in this case is the numerator and is equal to l cos 6 sinO/F. D F cos 9 sin 6 and the value F [m sin 0 sin 0'cos O/sin 0 cos 9 m( 1 cos 0)]. Since the value F is used in both the numerator and the denominator, the circuit for producing it will first be described. As indicated, the first term of F, namely, m sin 6 is generated by combining m and sin 0 in multiplier 108. This value is then added to the second term of PS numerator, sin 0 cost) by adder 109 which combines the outputs of multiplier 107 and multiplier 108. This value forms the input a of ratio device 110 and is divided by the denominator which comes from combining m with the value 1 c05 0. These values are derived from combining cos 0 with the value 1 in adder unit 111 whose input is a constant voltage, such as battery 112. Multiplier 113 then combines m (l cos 0)for subadder 115 with the ratio sin 0/F derived from ratio device 116, whose input is F from ratio device 110 and sinO from squarer 105. To form the value D of the formula for p, the output of ratio device 110 is supplied to multiplier 117 where it is combined with the c05 0 from squarer 106 and then added to sindby adder\" 118 to form the value F C0526 sin 0. This value is then square rooted by device 119 and compared to the in ratio device F to the square root of F derived from square root device 120, to produce the value V F/D. The final value of p is then supplied by the multiplying N X VFYD in multiplier unit 122. This output isthe input to Box 0 and used in'the equationsolved by the circuit'otl FlG..8. FIG. 10 has 0 from FIG. 8, and )t as inputs, the anisotropy X is also-calculated from 5, which is fed into a device similar to the one shown in FIG. 5 (which used an actual dip meter) but in such a device, the signal is now b'frem the sweep generator 101 of FIG. 8. With 0 and X thus given, FIG. 10 shows a method to correct the resistivity of a non-inductive recorded E-log (designated as p,,( 0 with dip present, in accordance with the equation: rati p ()1 sin 5+ 5: 0051 5 3: Pv PAW) X2 From the above equation it can be seen that p,,(()) is written on record tape by head 126 and is derived with Kin ratio device 135 to form the value as a ratio of the recorded or apparent electric log resisthe above formula. The numerator is formed by a combination of the sine and cosine values of 0 andi in the following way. dis first resolved into. cos fiand sin 5, respectively, by cosine and sine generators 127 and 128. The values are then squared in units 129 and 130; the output of cos 6 from square 129 is then multiplied through multiplier 131 with 7, derived from squarer 132. The outputs of multiplier 131 and 130 are then added to unit 133 to form the numerator. The square root of this value is extracted by unit 134 and combined Vsinl) X c05 9 The ratio from unit 135 is then applied to another ratio device 136 to combine that value with the resistivity read from an actual E-log on chart 137 by head 138. The output of 136 is then applied to the true E-log resistivity printed on chart 125 as p,,(0). As indicated above, the true vertical resistivity value p is then obtained by combining the value of p,,(0) squared in unit 140 and multiplied by the value 31 in multiplier 141 to produce the true vertical resistivity p which is then inscribed on tape 142 by head 143. The true electric log resistivity corrected for dip, as indicated on 125 is, of course, also the true horizontal resistivity, assuming nodip in the formation. While the units shown for conversion of the instantaneous values of logs in FIGS. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are indicated generally as analog devices, it will be understood that these values can be calculated by hand, or they can be calculated by digital computers which suitably digitize the individual value of each log at a particular depth and are then synchronized for the other values on similar logs and the values combined in the sequence specified in the drawings. In this regard, the flow diagrams and the extraction of the values from the variables are well known in computing art either in analog form, or in digital form. The preferred method, of course, is a digital computer; however, for simplicity of explanation and for a more ready understanding of the concept of how the information derived from a triple coil induction log can be used, the oresent representations have been selected. 7 Examples of sine or cosine resolvers, squarers, ad- .ders, subtractors, absolute value generators, square root extractors, multipliers, and ratio devices are given in'I-Iandbook of Automation, Computation and Control, Grabbe, Ramo, Wooldridge, Vol. 2, Computers & Data Processing, Chapter 23.

        "Abstract": "A method of determining dip, anisotropy, and true resistivity of an earth formation dipping relative to a well bore traversing it by inducing an electromagnetic field in the earth formation with an alternating current transmitting coil to cause electrical currents to flow in the earth formations to generate an e.m.f. in three detector coils spaced from the transmitting coil. The coils lie in mutually perpendicular planes, preferably with a common center point for their respective axes. By combining the signal from two of the coils and taking the ratio of the square root of the sum of the squares of these signals to the signal in the other coil, an electrical quantity representative of the dip and anisotropy of the earth formation is generated. With a knowledge of dip of the formation from a conventional dipmeter log and said electrical quantities, the anisotropy (the square root of the ratio of vertical to horizontal resistivity of the formation) if any, can be identified. In the absence of other dip information, the electrical anisotropy and dip of the formation is identified by using said electrical quantities with a conventional electric log of the non-inductive type. From such anisotropy, true vertical resistivity of the formation can be determined provided true horizontal resistivity is known. No knowledge of the strike of the formation relative to the borehole is required to measure either dip or anisotropy.",

FIG. 3 provides an ABS view block representation of a portion of an example magnetic element capable of being used in the data storage device of FIG. 1. FIG. 4 displays an ABS view block representation of a portion of an example magnetic element constructed and operated in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 5 graphs operational data from example magnetic elements constructed and operated in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 6 plots operational data from example magnetic elements constructed and operated in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 7 provides a flowchart generally illustrative of an example magnetic element fabrication routine conducted in accordance with various embodiments. Detailed Description [0024] As data storage devices have advanced to higher data capacity and faster data access times, various data components have reduced in size. For example, data bits have become more densely packed on narrower data tracks of a data storage media. Such an increase in data bit density can result inadvertent reading of data bits from adjacent data tracks in a \"side reading\" condition. The introduction of lateral magnetic shields to a data access element can mitigate side shielding, but may introduce magnetic asymmetry and instability as lateral shields conduct magnetic flux. Hence, there is a continued demand to stabilize magnetic shielding in reduced form factor data storage devices. [0025] Accordingly, a magnetic element can be configured with a magnetic stack adjacent to and separated from a side shield on an air bearing surface with the side shield having a predetermined anisotropy gradient along a down-track direction. The ability to tune the side shield to varying predetermined anisotropy gradients can allow intrinsic anisotropy to be uniformly distributed in the cross-track direction, which aids in stabilizing magnetization in the magnetic element. A tuned side shield configuration providing a predetermined anisotropy gradient may further allow for optimized side shield magnetization control in relation to the magnetically sensing aspects of the magnetic stack to minimize magnetization asymmetry. [0026] While tuned magnetic elements may be utilized by a variety of data storage devices, such as rotating media data readers and writers, FIG. 1 generally illustrates a block representation of a transducing portion 100 of an example data storage device that can utilize tuned side shields in accordance with various embodiments. The transducing portion 100 is shown in a non-limiting environment having an actuating assembly 102 that positions a transducing head 104 over a magnetic storage media 106 that is capable of storing programmed bits 108. The storage media 106 is attached to a spindle motor 110 that rotates during use to produce an air bearing surface (ABS) 112 on which a slider portion 114 of the actuating assembly 102 flies to position a head gimbal assembly (HGA) 116, which includes the transducing head 104, over a predetermined portion of the media 106. [0027] The transducing head 104 can include one or more transducing elements, such as a magnetic writer and magnetically responsive reader, which operate to program and read data from the storage media 106, respectively. In this way, controlled motion of the actuating assembly 102 causes the transducers to align with tracks (not shown) defined on the storage media surfaces to write, read, and rewrite data. It should be noted that the term \"stack\" is an unlimited term within this disclosure that can be one or more magnetic and non-magnetic layers capable of magnetic shielding, reading, and writing. [0028] Throughout the present application, the term \"stack\" will be understood to mean a component positioned on the ABS to conduct magnetic flux in accordance with predetermined characteristics, such as rotating a magnetic free layer, inducing a magnetic polarity onto an adjacent data storage media, and directing flux away from a data sensing region of a magnetic element. As an example, but not in any way limiting, a side stack can be a single layer of magnetically conductive material while a magnetic stack may be a lamination of magnetic and non-magnetic layers capable of writing or reading programmed data bits. [0029] As data bits 108 become more densely positioned in data tracks having smaller widths, the head 104 may receive magnetic flux from inadvertent data bits located on adjacent data tracks, which induces magnetic noise and asymmetry detrimental to accurate data sensing. The addition of one or more laterally adj acent magnetic shields can reduce the migration of errant magnetic flux to the magnetically sensitive portions of the head 104, but at the cost of increased magnetic instability as the shields become magnetically saturated. [0030] FIG. 2 shows a block representation of an ABS portion of an example magnetic element 120 capable of being used in the transducing portion 100 of FIG. 1. The magnetic element 120 is configured with a magnetic stack 122 disposed between laterally adjacent side shields 124. The lateral position and magnetically separated construction of the side shields 124 from the magnetic stack 22 may shield errant magnetic flux from reaching the magnetic stack 122. Likewise, leading 126 and trailing 128 shields can operate individually and in concert with the side shields 124 to define a data bit window with cross-track 130 and down-track 132 dimensions in which the magnetic stack 122 senses data bits across an air bearing. [0031] The material, shape, and position of the various shields 124, 126, and 128 can tune the magnetic resolution of the magnetic stack 122 to shrink the data bit window to correspond with the data bit density and data track width of an adjacent data storage media. However, the soft magnetic material of side stacks 124 and interruption of the material at the junction between the side stack 124 and trailing shield 128 can induce magnetic instability and asymmetry in the sensitive portions of the magnetic stack 122. [0032] With the continued elevation of data bit densities and the increasingly close construction of side shields 124 to the magnetic stack 122 in mind, FIG. 3 displays an ABS portion of an example magnetic element 140 constructed in accordance with various embodiments. The magnetic element 140 is shown with a magnetic stack 142 constructed with a trapezoidal shape and as a \"trilayer\" magnetic lamination characterized by first and second magnetically free layers 144 and 146 and a lack of any fixed magnetizations, such as a pinned reference layer. The magnetic stack 142 is disposed between side shields 148 that are respectively formed atop seed layers 150 and shaped with sidewalls tapered at an angle that is the same, or different, than the taper of the magnetic stack 142 sidewalls. [0033] Each side shield 148 can be configured with a predetermined anisotropy gradient (variation) where the anisotropy at point 152 differs from down-track point 154. The anisotropy in the down-track direction can tuned to vary in a number of non-limiting manners, such as with anisotropy that continuously increases or decreases in magnitude in the down-track direction (or vice versa) in the form of a gradient. Contrawise, the anisotropy may have variations with one or more areas of increased magnitude and one or more areas of decreased magnitude along the down-track direction. [0034] Various embodiments construct the respective side shields 148 with different anisotropy gradients while other embodiments configure the same anisotropy gradient for both side shields 148. In either a common or dissimilar anisotropy gradient embodiment, uniaxial anisotropy can be set to be substantially cross-track, along the X direction, while anisotropy gradually decreases from point 152 to down-track point 154. That is, the anisotropy of one, or both, side shields 148 can be configured to be strongest proximal to the seed layer 150 and weakest distal the seed layer 150 in accordance with an anisotropy gradient that decreases in a uniform or non-uniform manner along the down-track direction. [0035] While the predetermined anisotropy gradient can be formed in a number of non-limiting manners, some embodiments deposit the seed layer 150 with a predetermined texture, such as by forming portions of the layer with oblique incidence sputtering. Such a predetermined texture can induce anisotropy that has a predetermined gradient along the down-track direction while maintaining a substantially uniform cross-track anisotropy profile. The ability to tune the anisotropy of one, or both, side shields 148 in the cross-track 156 and down-track 158 directions allows for more precise magnetization control as magnetic flux saturates the side shield 148 in a pattern corresponding with the predetermined anisotropy. [0036] FIG. 4 illustrates a block representation of an ABS view of another example magnetic element 160 constructed in accordance with some embodiments that employs an abutted junction magnetic stack 162 laterally adjacent and separated from a laminated side shield 164. The fixed magnetization incorporated into magnetic stack 162 can be formed in any variety of non-limiting of fixed magnetization configurations, but in the embodiment of FIG. 4 a pinning layer 166, such as an antiferromagnet, fixes the magnetization of a pinned layer 168. The magnetic stack 162 further has a magnetically free layer 170 separated from the pinned layer 168 by a non-magnetic spacer layer 172, which allows for magnetoresistive sensing of data bits. [0037] The predetermined anisotropy gradient for the side shield 164 can be designed and formed in relation to the construction of the magnetic stack 162. As an example, a predetermined minimal anisotropy can be positioned proximal the magnetic free layer 170 at points 174 and 176 while a predetermined elevated anisotropy proximal the pinned layer 168 at points 178 and 180. Such anisotropy distribution may correspond with a gradient that continually reduces the anisotropy of the side shield 164 from point 180 to point 174 through points 178 and 176, which may be constructed by depositing a series of ferromagnetic shield layers 182 and 184 on a textured seed layer 186. [0038] Deposition of the ferromagnetic shield layers 182 and 184 can be tuned by adjusting layer thickness 188, material, and seed layer 186 texture to provide different, but continually decreasing, anisotropies for the respective points 174, 176, 178, and 180. In various embodiments, a predetermined anisotropy gradient of 600 Oersted from point 180 to point 174 is set by positioning a second textured seed layer 190 between the ferromagnetic shield layers 182 and 184 to provide a texture for the second ferromagnetic layer 184 that differs from the texture of the first seed layer 186. Similar anisotropy characteristics may be formed by depositing portions of the ferromagnetic shield layer 184 with an oblique incidence sputtering or post-deposition processing that provides a texture for ferromagnetic shield layer 182 that differs from the texture of the seed layer 186. [0039] Regardless of the number of layers, material, and textures implemented into the side shield 164, the ability to tune those and other shield characteristics can correspond to magnetic operation catered to high data bit density, reduced form factor data storage environments. FIG. 5 graphs operational data corresponding to example magnetic elements tuned with a predetermined side shield anisotropy gradient in accordance with various embodiments. Segmented 200 and solid 202 lines respectively correspond to magnetic elements that have no side shield anisotropy (line 200) and 600 Oersted average side shield anisotropy (line 202). As shown, the lack of anisotropy gradient in a side shield can produce a readback signal dip 204 for certain cross-track positions in a magnetic stack. [0040] The tuning of the anisotropy in a side shield, as represented in a non-limiting configuration, can eliminate the signal dip 204 by making side shield magnetization stability more robust, which reduces magnetic stack instability and asymmetry. FIG. 6 plots how differently tuned example magnetic elements exhibit similar readback signal in relation to the down-track position on the magnetic stack. The minimal difference between a magnetic element having a side shield with a 10 Oersted average anisotropy, as represented by solid line 210, and the magnetic element with a 1000 Oersted average anisotropy, as represented by segmented line 212, illustrates how tuned side shield configurations can optimize cross-track magnetic resolution, as displayed in FIG. 5, without being a detriment to down-track magnetic resolution, as displayed in FIG. 6. [0041] A tuned embodiment may configure a side shield with a 400 Oersted average anisotropy and anisotropy gradient that uniformly decreases that anisotropy to near zero proximal a magnetically free layer. Such an embodiment is generally represented by segmented line 214, which displays the down-track resolution that corresponds to optimized performance metrics, like PW50. It should be noted that the tuned configuration of a side shield anisotropy gradient is meant as the average anisotropy change along over a down-track distance, such as from point 180 to point 174. [0042] FIG. 7 provides an exemplary magnetic element fabrication routine 220 conducted in accordance with various embodiments to provide side shield laminations configured to provide flux closure through the top shield. The routine 220 can begin by determining the configuration of the side shields and magnetic stack in step 222. As discussed above, the number of layers, material, and thickness of the side shield layers can be chosen in relation to the magnetic stack. For example, the magnetic stack can be constructed as a trilayer with no fixed magnetization or as a reference stack with a fixed magnetization layer. [0043] The determination of the configurations of the respective side shield and magnetic stack in step 222 then advances the routine 220 to step 224 where at least the anisotropy gradient of the side shield is designed. Various embodiments configure the anisotropy gradient in relation to the design of the magnetic stack. For instance, a magnetic stack including a fixed magnetization can choose an anisotropy gradient that positions a low anisotropy proximal a free layer of the magnetic stack. Step 226 next forms the one or more seed layers with a predetermined texture that corresponds to the anisotropy gradient designed in step 224. The manner of texture formation may be determined in steps 224 and 226, but are not limited to any particular means, such as oblique sputtering and post-formation processing. [0044] In some embodiments, a single seed layer is formed in step 226 that continuously extends from one side shield to another, across the magnetic stack, which allows the texture of the seed layer to induce anisotropy in both the side shields and the magnetic stack itself. Regardless of how the seed layer is textured or shaped, step 228 can subsequently form the magnetic stack and side shields in concurrent or successive deposition processes conforming to the dimensions and materials determined in steps 222 and 224. [0045] It can be appreciated that through the routine 220, a magnetic element with tuned magnetic stack and side shields can be constructed to provide optimized magnetic stability and asymmetry. However, the routine 220 is not limited as the various steps can be omitted, changed, and added. For instance, the routine 220 can further include steps that form and process one or more additional seed layers with predetermined textures between side shield ferromagnetic layers to provide the predetermined anisotropy gradient designed in step 224. [0046] It can be appreciated that the tuning of one or more side shields in a magnetic element can provide reduced form factor data transducing components catered to increased data bit density environments. The ability to tune the magnetic saturation of a side shield by setting a predetermined anisotropy gradient allows for increased control of side shield magnetization, which can be direct magnetic flux to predetermined portions of the side shields that are distal the magnetically sensitive regions of an adjacent magnetic stack. Moreover, the construction of a side shield with a predetermined anisotropy gradient can provide a finer data bit magnetic window from a magnetic stack without degrading cross-track or down-track resolution. [0047] It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments, this detailed description is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangements of parts within the principles of the present disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the particular elements may vary depending on the particular application without departing from the scope of the present technology.",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0005] 1 . Field of the Invention [0006] This invention pertains generally to magneto-resistance (MR) sensors, and more particularly to magneto-resistance (MR) sensors which may incorporate spin valve or magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices. [0007] 2. Description of Related Art [0008] Magneto-resistance (MR) sensors based on spin valve and magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices have been widely used in applications such as magnetic field sensors, position and rotation sensors, as well as medical applications because of their large signal, low power consumption, and long endurance. [0009] In magnetic sensors, the central issue is the linear and reversible response to the magnetic field. At present, one popular method is to align the magnetizations of a sensing layer and a reference layer to be initially perpendicular to each other in the plane of the film. This can be obtained by introducing an external or internal transverse bias field, or by utilizing shape anisotropy and step edge anisotropy. However, such designs complicate sensor design, and suffer from magnetization fluctuation and magnetic noise when reducing sensor size. This limits the scalability and integration for applications. [0010] Another approach employs out-of-plane magnetized materials to achieve a linear and hysteresis-free response. For example, linear response and large linear field range have been obtained in sensors with a perpendicularly magnetized reference layer and in-plane sensing layer. A sensor with a high linearity up to applied field of 500 Oe has been demonstrated by using Pt/CoFe out-of-plane magnetized sensing layer. However, multilayer-based structures using transition metals such as Pt- and Pd- multilayer structures exhibit small MR due to their low spin polarization, further resulting in low sensitivity. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] An aspect of the present invention is a nanoscale linear magnetoresistance sensor with an in-plane magnetized reference layer and a sensing layer with interfacial perpendicular anisotropy. The sensor exhibits high TMR and a tunable free layer magnetization (e.g. magnetization direction tunable to be in-plane, canted, or out-of-plane), which leads to high sensitivity and linearity. The sensor exhibits a large field sensitivity (demonstrated up to 0.02%/Oe) and a high linear field range (demonstrated up to 600Oe). It is appreciated that actual sensitivity and linear field range values may exceed those demonstrated. [0012] The present invention incorporates CoFeB materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for MgO based devices such as spin valve and magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices in magnetic field sensors including speed, position and rotation sensors (e.g. used for the automotive industry), hard disk drive read heads, medical applications, etc. [0013] The sensors of the present invention exhibit high MR value (typically larger than -10%) and large interfacial perpendicular anisotropy (IPA) (typically larger than 0.2 mJ/m2). The utilization of CoFeB with large IPA for building sensors produces high sensitivity due to its high MR ratio when used in MgO based MTJ structures. [0014] Another aspect is a nanoscale MTJ sensor with a CoFeB sensing layer that exhibits perpendicular anisotropy. A unique material structure and device design are used to realize a superior sensor with an out-of-plane magnetization free layer (or partially in-plane free layer with perpendicular anisotropy) and in-plane reference layer. Interfacial anisotropy is used in layered material structures based on dielectric oxides (e.g. MgO) and metallic ferromagnets (e.g. Fe-rich CoFeB such as Co4oFe4oB2o or Co2oFe6oB2o)- The use of the interfacial anisotropy allows for simultaneous realization of high perpendicular anisotropy (hence a very linear sensor response) and a high magnetoresistance ratio (hence a high sensitivity in the sensor), achieving overall superior performance to the state of the art. [0015] Additionally, the interfacial anisotropy (and hence the sensor response in terms of sensitivity and linearity) of the sensor of the present invention may be tuned by application of a DC bias voltage to the device, allowing for voltage tunability of the sensor response. [0016] In another embodiment, a very high resistance tunnel structure (for example with a thick MgO > 1 nm) may be used to achieve a high- resistance sensor, which allows for ultralow power consumption due to small leakage currents. [0017] In one aspect, the device of the present invention comprises a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor with an in-plane magnetized reference layer and (partial or complete) out-of-plane magnetized free (sensing) layer, separated by a dielectric oxide (for example MgO). [0018] In a preferred embodiment, the perpendicular anisotropy originates at the interface of the free layer with its neighboring layers, and is therefore sensitive to its thickness. The device exhibits high TMR (i.e. larger than -10%) to achieve high sensitivity. The device linearity is sensitive to the free layer thickness, and the sensor response (sensitivity and/or linearity) can be tuned by an applied voltage, [0019] In one embodiment, the dielectric barrier may be made thick (e.g. > 1 nm) to allow only for a small leakage current, allowing for low-power operation and energy-efficient voltage-controlled tuning. [0020] In another embodiment, the free (sensing) layer material may comprise an Fe-rich metallic film such as Fe, or CoFe, or CoFeB. [0021] In a further embodiment, the free layer may be additionally capped (or seeded) by an appropriate metal layer that may serve both as part of a measurement contact, as well as to promote the perpendicular anisotropy. Such metal layer may comprise Ta, Ru, Hf, Pt, Pd, Cu, or the like material. [0022] In a further embodiment, the free layer may be additionally capped (or seeded) by an appropriate oxide layer that may serve both as part of a measurement contact, as well as to promote the perpendicular anisotropy or voltage control of the sensor response. Such oxide layer may comprise MgO, TaOx, HfOx, or the like material. [0023] The TMR sensor of the present invention may be integrated as part of a circuit to sense its resistance as a function of applied magnetic field for various applications. It may also be included as part of a sensor array to achieve high sensitivity and directionality, or as part of one of a range of established resistance-based sensing circuits (such as a Wheatstone bridge). [0024] Further aspects of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S) [0025] The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following drawings which are for illustrative purposes only: [0026] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a layer structure and magnetic configuration of a magnetoresistance sensor in accordance with the present invention. [0027] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the sensor of FIG. 1 with a capping layer. [0028] FIG. 3A through FIG. 3E show plots of resistance as a function of the applied magnetic field for the sensor of FIG. 1 with different sensing layer thicknesses. [0029] FIG. 4A shows a plot of the resistance as a function of applied magnetic field curve for a sensor with a CoFeB sensing layer of tC0FeB = 1 .36 nm in the low magnetic field regime. [0030] FIG. 4B shows the nonlinearity in the magnetoresistance for different CoFeB sensing layer thicknesses. The light gray box in FIG. 4B illustrates the range where nonlinearity is less than 1 %. [0031] FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B show plots of the field sensing range and sensitivity, respectively, as a function of the CoFeB sensing layer thickness. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0032] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a layer structure 10 and magnetic configuration of a magnetoresistance sensor in accordance with the present invention. The sensing structure primarily comprises a free (sensing) layer 12 separated from a reference layer 16 by a dielectric barrier 14. Dielectric barrier 14 preferably comprises a dielectric oxide (e.g. MgO). [0033] In a preferred embodiment, the reference layer 16 is part of a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer, composed of the reference layer 16, the pinned layer 20, and a spacer layer 18, where the spacer layer 18 preferably comprises a metal layer such as Ru. [0034] In another embodiment, the reference layer 16 comprises a Co-rich layer (e.g. Co6oFe2oB2o or Co4oFe4oB2o)- The magnetization of the Co-rich reference layer 16 is aligned parallel to the film plane (e.g. direction 32 in FIG. 1 ). [0035] In a further embodiment, the sensing (free) layer 12 comprises an Fe-rich layer such as Co2oFe6oB2o or Co4oFe4oB2o- The sensing layer 12 comprises a thickness tC0FeB within the range of approximately 0.8 nm ~ 2.3 nm), to allow for tuning its perpendicular anisotropy by changing the thickness of the sensing layer. In some embodiments, depending on material selection or layer configuration, the thickness may range from 1 .30 nm to ~ 1 .85 nm. Below a certain transition thickness, the magnetization (i.e. magnetic moment) direction 30 of the sensing layer 12 is perpendicular to the film plane. In this scheme, there is no need for a sensor with a large aspect ratio or external bias field, which is necessary for in-plane sensors in order to achieve linear output. [0036] The structure 10 shown in FIG. 1 is shown in use in a magnetic tunnel junction configuration, with two ferromagnetic layers 16, 20 separated by a metallic spacer (e.g. coupling or spacer layer 18 comprising Ru). Such a configuration comprises a ferromagnetic pinned layer 20 (e.g. comprising having magnetization direction 34 opposite to magnetization direction 32 of reference layer 16). An extra anti-ferromagnetic layer 22 (e.g. PtMn or IrMn) may be included to pin the orientation of the ferromagnets. The magnetic field H to be sensed by the device is in plane for this device 10. [0037] The dielectric barrier 14 may be made thick (e.g. > 1 nm) to allow only for a small leakage current, allowing for low-power operation and energy-efficient voltage-controlled tuning. [0038] While the free (sensing) layer 12 comprises Co2oFe6oB2o or Co4oFe4oB2o in a preferred embodiment, it is contemplated that sensing layer 12 material may comprise other Fe-rich metallic films such as Fe, or CoFe, or CoFeB. [0039] It is also appreciated that other layer configurations from those depicted in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are contemplated. For example, dielectric or MgO layer may be positioned above sensing layer 12. Furthermore, the device 10 may be fabricated in reverse order, with sensing layer 12 at the bottom and anti-ferromagnetic layer 22 at the top. [0040] Layer configuration 10 provides better scalability, a simple structure and high sensitivity. Furthermore, the tunability of the perpendicular anisotropy of the CoFeB sensing layer 12 by adjusting its thickness allows one to easily design various magnetic sensors for specific applications. [0041] Referring to the layer configuration 50 of FIG. 2, the free layer 12 may be additionally capped (or seeded) by an appropriate metal or dielectric layer 24 that may serve both as part of a measurement contact, as well as to promote the perpendicular anisotropy or voltage control of anisotropy. In one embodiment, layer 24 may comprise a metal such asTa, Ru, Hf, Pt, Pd, or the like material. In an alternative embodiment, layer 24 may comprise an oxide layer, comprising e.g. MgO, TaOx, HfOx, or the like material. [0042] Referring to the layer configurations 10 of FIG. 1 and 50 of FIG. 2, in both cases the perpendicular anisotropy of the CoFeB sensing layer 12 may be tuned by application of a voltage (i.e. electric field) across the dielectric barrier 14, allowing one to tune the magnetic sensor properties using an applied voltage. [0043] Experimental Results [0044] The magnetic multilayers were deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate (not shown) in a physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. The completed stack was annealed for 2 hours at 300 \u00b0C in 1 T. Electron-beam lithography and ion milling were used to define and etch the MTJ layers resulting in circular nanopillars with nominal diameters of 60 nm, 80 nm, and 100 nm. The experimental results for the devices with the different diameters show similar behavior and all data shown below are for 80 nm circular nanopillars. The magneto-transport measurements were performed by a G- S-G probe at room temperature. [0045] FIG. 3A through FIG. 3E show plots of the resistance as a function of applied magnetic field by varying the sensing (free) layer 12 thickness (tcoFee)- For a device with tC0FeB = 1 -84 nm (shown in FIG. 3E), normal magnetoresistance (MR) behavior was observed with MR ratio of 82% [MR = (RAp-Rp)/Rp, where RAp and RP are the resistances for an antiparallel and parallel magnetization configuration, respectively.] This suggests that the magnetization (i.e. magnetic moment) direction 30 of the CoFeB sensing layer 12 is in the plane of the films. The slight shift in the MR curve is presumably due to the dipolar coupling, as well as orange peel coupling, between the reference and the sensing layers (this can be eliminated by choosing a compensated synthetic antiferromagnet for layers 16, 18, and 20). [0046] With decreasing sensing layer 12 thickness (tcoFee), the out-of-plane magnetization component of the sensing layer 12 continues to increase, and for tC0FeB = 1 -64 nm (shown in FIG. 3C), the linear response around zero field with hysteretic behavior is presented, indicating that the CoFeB sensing layer 12 exhibits a transition from in-plane magnetization to out-of- plane magnetization in zero-applied magnetic field. [0047] Further decreasing the thickness of the CoFeB sensing layer 12 to tcoFeB = 1 -53 nm (shown in FIG. 3B), the sensor response becomes linear and hysteresis-free around zero-applied field, indicating a stable single domain perpendicular state. [0048] At tcoFeB = 1 -36 nm (shown in FIG. 3A), the linearity extends to a large applied field of more than 1000 Oe. The CoFeB sensing layer 12 thickness dependence of the MR loops correlates to perpendicular anisotropy (magnetic moment 30) at the sensing layer 12 (CoFeB)/dielectric oxide layer 14 (MgO) interface, which has been confirmed by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurement. [0049] FIG. 4A shows the MR ratio as a function of the applied magnetic field for a sensor with sensing layer 12 thickness (tC0FeB) = 1 -36 nm in a range of fields of - 400 Oe < H < 400 Oe, which indicates that the magnetic field sensitivity is 0.017% MR/Oe. This value is significantly larger than that (0.0018% MR/Oe) previously reported for a sensor utilizing an out-of-plane magnetized sensing layer because of the significantly enhanced MR ratio in the case of the sensor 10 of the present invention. [0050] The nonlinearity, defined as 100x[R(H)-R0-r0H]/R(H) , is plotted in FIG. 4B, where R0 and r0 are coefficients obtained from linear regression of R(H) as a function of the applied magnetic field H. The nonlinearity depends strongly on the CoFeB sensing layer 12 thickness. To better understand the tC0FeB dependence of the field sensitivity and field sensing range, the data corresponding to the nonlinearity of smaller than 1 % were chosen for quantitative analysis. The linear field range increases while the field sensitivity decreases with decreasing tC0FeB, as shown in FIG. 5A. [0051] For tcoFeB = 1 .64 nm, the field sensitivity is up to 0.036% MR/Oe, but the linear field range is limited to 150 Oe. This is, however, larger than the range reported for sensors (0.0047% MR/Oe) with super-paramagnetic CoFeB layer with a similar field range. When the CoFeB sensing layer 12 thickness is less than 1 .53 nm, the field sensitivity only shows a small reduction (from 0.019 %MR/Oe at 1 .53 nm to 0.0165 %MR/Oe at 1 .36 nm). [0052] The linear field range substantially increases from 450 to 650 Oe as the CoFeB sensing layer 12 decreases from 1 .53 to 1 .36 nm. This changed trend is similar to that reported in the art for spin valve sensors with out-of- plane Pt/CoFe sensing layer, but a higher field sensitivity can be obtained in the sensors according to this invention, due to the larger MR effect with MgO barrier 14 and high spin polarization CoFeB layer 12. [0053] The following discussion details the underlying mechanisms of the free layer 12 thickness (tC0FeB) dependence of the field sensitivity and nonlinearity. For the sensor of the present invention, where the magnetization of the sensing free layer 12 is expected to coherently rotate toward the film plane, the resulting change in the sensor resistance is expressed as: R(H) -R(0) where HK = 2K /\u03bc\u03bf\u039c8, K = \u039a, tcoFeB -\u039c8 2/\u03bc\u03bf, Mo is permeability in free space, Ms is the saturation magnetization, and K, is the interfacial anisotropy. Thus for small rotation angles, the field sensitivity can be expressed as: [0054] From Eqn. 2 the field sensitivity is dependent on the MR ratio and Hk. However, for the sensor configuration 10 of the present invention, the MR ratio does not change significantly, while Hk increases strongly as the CoFeB sensing layer thickness is reduced. Therefore, Hk is dominant in the tcoFeB dependence of the field sensitivity, as shown in the FIG. 4B. As for nonlinearity, it can be seen from Eqn. 1 that the nonlinearity increases as the external magnetic field and MR increase, while it decreases as Hk increases, i.e., the nonlinearity decreases with the decrease of tC0FeB as shown in FIG. 4B. [0055] Optimizing the field sensitivity, field sensing range, linearity and reversibility (i.e. critical parameters for magnetic field sensors), our results show that, the devices with tC0FeB\u2264 1 -60 nm are promising for magnetic field sensors. In addition, the ability of tuning the sensor performance by changing the sensing layer thickness and applying voltages across the device presents a powerful method to design magnetic sensors for specific applications. [0056] It should be appreciated that detailed values of MR, interfacial anisotropy, and its thickness and voltage dependence vary greatly with the deposition and annealing conditions of the films. Hence, the specific numbers in this description are given for illustration and should not be understood to limit the scope of this invention. [0057] In summary, nano-scale MTJ sensors were fabricated with an in- plane magnetized reference layer and a perpendicular anisotropy sensing layer and the effect of thickness of the sensing layer on the magnetic sensor performance was systematically investigated. A sensitivity value of around 0.02% MR/Oe in the nano-scale MTJ was obtained with a sensing layer thickness smaller than 1 .60 nm. [0058] Furthermore, the field sensing range can be controlled merely by changing the thickness of the CoFeB sensing layer 12, or by application of a voltage across the device (more precisely across the dielectric barrier 14), which allows the MTJs to be designed for various magnetic field sensors. In addition, the nano-scale size and simple structure of the sensors of the present invention make them easy to integrate with complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor technology for nano-scale low-power-consumption sensors.

FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure generally relates to nanomagnetic signal propagation in information processing systems, and in particular relates to nanomagnets having widely tunable anisotropy properties. BACKGROUND There is interest in exploring the use of nanometer-scale magnets, or nanomagnets, in signal propagation in information processing systems. There has been some limited success in propagating a signal along a row of nanomagnets. A force is applied to a row of nanomagnets to cause the magnetization direction of each nanomagnet to align with its relatively unstable hard axis, and then the force is removed. The magnetization direction of a first nanomagnet in the row of nanomagnets is perturbed to cause the magnetization direction of the first nanomagnet to align with its relatively stable magnetically easy axis. Magnetic dipole field coupling between adjacent nanomagnets ideally causes a cascade of anti-parallel alignment of magnetization directions along the row of nanomagnets. However, cascade success depends on the magnetization direction of each nanomagnet staying in its relatively unstable magnetically hard-axis alignment until perturbed by the dipole field of the signal propagating from an adjacent nanomagnet. Experiments have shown that variables such as thermal fluctuations, transient electromagnetic fields, and lithographic inconsistencies can affect hard-axis stability and cause the magnetization direction in a nanomagnet to prematurely align with its magnetically easy axis, ruining the reliability of the cascade. Thus, there is a need to increase magnetically hard-axis magnetization stability in nanomagnets to increase the reliability of signal propagation. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides a nanomagnet having widely tunable anisotropy. The disclosed nanomagnet is a magnetic particle with a convex shape having a first magnetically easy axis. The convex shape is modified to include at least one concavity to urge a second magnetically easy axis to form substantially offset from the first magnetically easy axis. In another embodiment, a nanomagnet is provided with tunable anisotropy comprising a magnetic particle with a convex shape having a first magnetically easy axis, wherein the convex shape is modified to include at least one concavity to urge a second magnetically easy axis to form with a magnetic strength substantially different from the first magnetically easy axis. In an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus for propagating magnetic signals is disclosed. The apparatus includes a substrate on which a chain of nanomagnets is fabricated. Each of the chain of nanomagnets is made up of a magnetic particle with a convex shape having a first magnetically easy axis, wherein the convex shape includes at least one concavity to urge a second magnetically easy axis to form substantially offset from the first magnetically easy axis. Each of the chain of nanomagnets is separated by a distance that is close enough to allow a magnetization change in one of the chain of nanomagnets to cause adjacent ones of the chain of nanomagnets to change magnetization, thereby propagating a magnetic signal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The embodiments set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and illustrate the best mode of practicing the invention. Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawings, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the invention and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims. Nanomagnets typically have a relatively stable magnetic axis known as a magnetically easy axis and a relatively unstable magnetic axis known as a magnetically hard axis. The present disclosure provides a nanomagnetic logic architecture in which nanomagnets remain magnetized along what would normally be their magnetically hard axis until triggered to flip to their magnetically easy axis by the dipole field of their nearest neighbor. The requirement for this architecture to work is that each nanomagnet must exhibit dual-axis remanence, which provides zero-field stability along two orthogonal axes. This disclosure shows that remanence is a property that can be attained by engineering anisotropy properties of individual nanomagnets. Anisotropy in magnetic materials refers to a tendency to align magnetically in particular preferred directions. For the purpose of this disclosure, concave nanomagnets with widely tunable anisotropy properties are nanoscale magnetic elements in which an anisotropy profile can be broadly controlled by the presence of at least one concavity along one or more of the nanomagnet's sides. The tunable anisotropy properties arise not from altering the nominal dimensions such as length, width, and height or the material of the magnet, but rather from altering the depth of the at least one concavity. Experiments conducted in accordance with the present disclosure achieved up to 700% enhancement of the anisotropy strength in Fe-Ni based alloy (permalloy) nanomagnet squares with concave shapes in comparison with normal squares, as well as control over the direction of the magnetically easy axis. In addition, a design was verified pertaining to the functionality of a concave rectangle having a tunable composition of uniaxial and biaxial anisotropy. In particular, the applicability of concave nanomagnets with regard to nanomagnetic logic was tested. Measurement techniques based on the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) for characterizing anisotropy in single domain nanomagnets are usable to investigate the role of a nanomagnet's shape, size, and crystallinity on its anisotropy. In convex shaped nanomagnets, energetically favorable non-uniform magnetization patterns are found to induce configurational anisotropy with magnetically easy axes oriented towards either the corners or edges of the convex shape, depending on a film thickness making up the nanomagnets. For the purposes of this disclosure and the claims that follow, the term \u0093convex shape(s)\u0094 include convex polygons and shapes that bulge outward. A convex polygon is any polygon that has interior angles that are each strictly less than 180\u00b0. The above results imply that an ability to tune the anisotropy properties of the nanomagnet by changing its lithographically defined shape is available. A wide tuning of anisotropy properties provides for broad applicability to magnetic devices such as spin-based computational devices. However, a relatively small number of adjustable parameters in simple shapes such as rectangles, and squares has thus far limited applications of configurational anisotropy. Configurational anisotropy arises in single domain nanomagnets that adopt a non-uniform magnetization pattern to minimize magnetic charge at interfaces. The energy landscape in configuration space may contain local minima that do not exist when considering the case of uniform magnetization only, leading to complex anisotropy properties. One way to determine the approximate strength of configurational anisotropy in a particular shape is to associate an effective anisotropy field with each magnetization angle. If the anisotropy is predominantly uniaxial or biaxial, then the difference between the maximum and the minimum strength of the anisotropy field is related to the anisotropy energy density K which is given by the following equation. H anis=2K/M S, where M S is the saturation magnetization of the material. Past investigations of permalloy squares of 150 nm width and 15 nm thickness have demonstrated a biaxial anisotropy field of over 300 Oersted, with magnetically easy axes oriented along the square diagonals. One embodiment of the present disclosure provides a rectangle-derived nanomagnet shape, which has concavities along its two short edges (top and bottom) to obtain the desired anisotropy properties for nanomagnetic logic applications. As in an elliptical nanomagnet, the magnetically easy axis lies parallel to the long axis. However, unlike an elliptical nanomagnet, the concavities induce an additional magnetically easy axis along what is ordinarily the magnetically hard axis. To demonstrate this experimentally, large (1\u00d71 mm) arrays of nominally identical nanomagnets were fabricated using electron beam lithography followed by metal evaporation. FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an array section 10 of nominally identical nanomagnets 12. The center-to-center spacing (D) between nanomagnets is 750 nm. The nanomagnets 12 were defined by electron beam lithography using a silicon substrate 14 and polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) resist (not shown). After development in a solution of 7:3 isopropanol:water at \u22125\u00b0 C., a film of 10 nm Ni80Fe20 followed by 2 nm Al was deposited by electron beam evaporation. Next, the pattern was lifted off using a photoresist remover. The electron beam lithography was performed using an electron beam lithography tool having a 100 kV high brightness gun, a 50 MHz/20 bit intelligent pattern generator, a large field size capability of 1.2 mm at both 50 kV and 100 kV operation, and the capability of generating less than 10 nm lithography. The anisotropy properties of the finished arrays of nanomagnets were characterized using a MOKE magnetometer configured to perform modulated field magnetic anisometry (MFMA) measurements. The measurement yields the angular dependence of the anisotropy strength in the plane of the nanomagnets; maxima in the anisotropy profile indicate magnetically easy axes and minima indicate hard axes. Because configurational anisotropy depends on the non-uniform magnetization of the nanomagnets and requires each spin to be treated as an independent variable, quantifying cubic and uniaxial anisotropy parameters, as is done for uniformly magnetized particles, is not possible. FIG. 2A is an experimental anisotropy profile of a rectangular shaped permalloy concave nanomagnet 16 shown in FIG. 2B. The concave nanomagnet 16 has a concavity 18 on one end and another concavity 20 on an opposing end. The concave nanomagnet 16 has a first magnetically easy axis 22 that is a longitudinal axis and a second magnetically easy axis 24 that is a minor axis that is perpendicular to the first magnetically easy axis 22. Note that the first magnetically easy axis that is the longitudinal axis bisects or substantially bisects the concavities 18 and 20. The second magnetically easy axis 24 is denoted by the lobes that extend along the horizontal (0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0) direction of the experimental anisotropy profile of FIG. 2A. If the lobes were absent, the minor axis of the permalloy concave nanomagnet would be considered a magnetically hard axis. FIG. 3A is an experimental anisotropy profile of an ellipse shaped permalloy nanomagnet 26 shown in FIG. 3B. The nanomagnet 26 has a magnetically easy axis 28 that is a longitudinal axis and a magnetically hard axis 30 that is a minor axis that is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the magnetically easy axis 28. The magnetically hard axis 30 is denoted by the lack of lobes along the 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 direction of the experimental anisotropy profile of FIG. 3A. The concave nanomagnet 16 and the nanomagnet 26 both have nominal dimensions of 80 nm x 120 nm with a 10 nm thickness. The longitudinal axes of both the concave nanomagnet 16 and the nanomagnet 26 are dominant magnetically easy axes. Only the concave nanomagnet 16 with its rectangular shape includes a minor magnetically easy axis in the horizontal direction. FIG. 4 is a diagram depicting hysteresis loops representing MOKE magnetometry measurements along the second magnetically easy axis 24 of the concave nanomagnet 16 as well as along the magnetically hard axis 30 of the nanomagnet 26. The hysteresis loop depicted in solid line represents an MFMA signal in arbitrary units (a.u.) versus applied field (mT) for the concave nanomagnet 16. The hysteresis loop depicted in dashed line represents magnetization in a.u. versus applied field (mT) for the nanomagnet 26. In FIG. 4, arrows represent directions of magnetic fields for both the concave nanomagnet 16 and the nanomagnet 26. Unlike ellipsoidal nanomagnets such as nanomagnet 26, concave nanomagnets such as concave nanomagnet 16 exhibit hysteresis along what would normally be a magnetically hard axis, while both exhibit hysteresis along their magnetically easy axis. The observation of dual-axis remanence implies that the anisotropy energy barriers that separate the two stable axes are significantly larger than the thermal energy, kT, at room temperature. A comparison of the effect of concavity depth is illustrated in the next few Figures. FIG. 5A is an experimental anisotropy profile of a substantially square shaped permalloy nanomagnet 32 having no concavities as shown in FIG. 5B. As depicted in the experimental anisotropy profile (FIG. 5A), a magnetically easy axis EA is formed along a diagonal that extends roughly from one corner of the nanomagnet 32 to another corner of the nanomagnet 32. A magnetically hard axis HA exists roughly perpendicular to the magnetically easy axis EA. FIG. 6A is an experimental anisotropy profile of a substantially square shaped permalloy nanomagnet 34 having 10 nm concavities as shown in FIG. 6B. Notice that the magnetically easy axis and magnetically hard axis are now rotated to roughly bisect the 10 nm concavities. FIG. 7A is an experimental anisotropy profile of a substantially square shaped permalloy nanomagnet 36 having 20 nm concavities as shown in FIG. 7B. Similar to the exemplary 10 nm concavity case of FIG. 6B, the magnetically easy axis and magnetically hard axis roughly bisect the 20 nm concavities. FIG. 8 is a graph comparing anisotropy of permalloy magnets having 0 nm, 10 nm, and 20 nm concavities, respectively. In particular, the graph plots MFMA signal in a.u. versus applied field (H) in milliTesla (mT). An inset plot associated with FIG. 8 of applied magnetic field (HANIS) versus concavity depth shows that the measured strength of the anisotropy in nanomagnets as a function of concavity depth is widely tunable. In association with the above results, micromagnetic simulations using object oriented micro magnetic framework (OOMMF) software were carried out to investigate the origins of configurational anisotropy enhancement in concave nanomagnets. FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C, and 9D compare magnetization patterns of normal and concave square nanomagnets when magnetized along both 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 axes. When magnetized along magnetically easy axes, the nanomagnets were allowed to relax to their stable configuration, and along the magnetically hard axes, the nanomagnets were held fixed with uniform magnetization. FIGS. 10A, 10B, 10C, and 10D show a distribution of demagnetization energy density for each configuration. A high demagnetization energy density arises from magnetic charge accumulation at the surface of the nanomagnets. FIG. 9A depicts a concave square magnetization along a magnetically easy axis of 0\u00b0. FIG. 10A in association with FIG. 9A shows that regions of the high demagnetization energy are located on opposite sides of the concave square. This indicates that the magnetic charges are well separated. Conversely, FIG. 10B associated with FIG. 9B shows that regions of the high demagnetization energy are concentrated intensely in the upper left and lower right corners of the a nanomagnet when a concave square is magnetized along the hard axis of 45\u00b0. This indicates that the large concentration of magnetic charge of opposite polarity accumulates in close proximity to each other as a result of a constricted geometry near the corners. Further narrowing of the nanomagnets corners by increasing the concavity depth would continue to increase the total demagnetization energy of the 45\u00b0 magnetization state. For comparison, FIG. 9C depicts a square nanomagnet without concavities that is magnetized along its hard axis at 0\u00b0. FIG. 10C associated with FIG. 9C shows that there remains a relatively large distance between the uncompensated spins for a nanomagnet without concavities. FIG. 9D depicts a square nanomagnet without concavities that has a magnetization oriented at 45\u00b0. FIG. 10D in association with FIG. 9D shows an outward bowed magnetization configuration that concentrates magnetic charges in opposite corners, where the magnetic charges are the furthest apart from each other. The maximal separation between opposing charges means the diagonal axis is a magnetically easy axis. Overall, the difference in demagnetization energy between the magnetically easy and magnetically hard axes of the square nanomagnet without concavities is significantly smaller than that of a concave square. Thus, configurational anisotropy is greatly enhanced in concave nanomagnets in comparison to traditional geometries such as square nanomagnets. FIG. 11 is a diagram showing results of micromagnetic simulations that predict information in a nanomagnets logic circuit with biaxial anisotropy will propagate in a characteristic cascade like manner. The micromagnetic simulations verify that this mode of signal propagation occurs in chains of concave nanomagnets. A simulated chain of nanomagnets 38 are situated between a between an input magnet 40 and an output magnet 42. For comparison, a chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44 with equivalent dimensions is also simulated. The elliptical nanomagnets 44 are similarly situated between an input magnet 46 and an output magnet 48. In both simulations, the input magnet 40 and input magnet 46 are fixed in the vertical direction to set the desired output state of the chain of concave nanomagnets 38 and the chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44, respectively. Moreover, the output magnet 42 and the output magnet 48 are both fixed to the horizontal direction to stabilize the last one of the chain of concave nanomagnets 38 and the last one of the chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44, respectively. The chain of concave nanomagnets 38 and the chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44 are both initialized along the horizontal axis by an applied magnetic field of 150 mT, which is removed linearly over the first 1 ns of each simulation time to initialize signal propagation. The temperature parameter in the simulation is set to 300\u00b0 K. Each of the concave nanomagnets 38 remains magnetized in its metastable state along the horizontal axis until its nearest adjacent one of concave nanomagnets 38 flips and produces a dipole field in the vertical direction. This action gives rise to a predicted cascade like magnetic signal propagation behavior. By contrast, the chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44 through stochastic thermal processes cause at least some of the elliptical nanomagnets 44 to flip to the vertical axis too rapidly for the information from the input magnet to propagate reliably down the chain of elliptical nanomagnets 44. As a result, some of the elliptical nanomagnets 44 flip to a logically incorrect state that is typically parallel to a nearest adjacent one of the elliptical nanomagnets 44. Simulations carried out using nanomagnets with different concavity shapes, e.g., with rounded rather than pointed ends, exhibited similar cascade-like signal propagation behavior. Photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) experiments verified the unique behavior of chains of concave nanomagnets. Magnetic circular dichroism of circularly polarized x-rays was used to generate magnetic contrast images with sensitivity along the magnetically easy axes of the nanomagnets. Magnetic contrast images of a chain of concave nanomagnets having concavity depths of 40 nm, 30 nm, and 20 nm, respectively were taken. The nanomagnet dimensions were 80 nm\u00d7160 nm with 10 nm thickness. The concavity depth was varied between 20 and 40 nm. Prior to magnetic imaging, a 220 mT magnetic field was applied along the horizontal axis of the chain and subsequently removed over 30 seconds. The sample was then inserted into the PEEM chamber and magnetic contrast images were taken. The results of the PEEM experiments suggest that nanomagnets with 20 nm concavity depth were not sufficiently stabilized along the horizontal axis by biaxial anisotropy; all the nanomagnets flip to the vertical axis, but errors (nearest neighbors aligned parallel to one another) were observed in the output state of the chain. On the other hand, nanomagnets with 40 nm concavity depth did not flip to the vertical axis at all (the lack of magnetic contrast indicates horizontal magnetization). This implies that the biaxial anisotropy was strong relative to the uniaxial anisotropy, so the magnets remained locked in the horizontal direction. Finally, nanomagnets with 30 nm concavity depth demonstrate an appropriate balance of biaxial and uniaxial anisotropy, as error-free signal propagation occurs along the first seven nanomagnets in the chain. FIG. 12 is a PEEM micrograph that provides observation of subdomain magnetization. In particular, FIG. 12 shows a chain of concave nanomagnets 50 disposed on a substrate 52. A single concave nanomagnet 54 shown in a cutaway view has a first magnetically easy axis shown by a longitudinally aligned black arrow. In this exemplary case, a magnetization of the concave nanomagnet 54 is substantially aligned with the first magnetically easy axis as denoted by a relatively large and uniform light region that is in contrast with adjacent nanomagnets and substrate 52. If the magnetization of the concave nanomagnet 54 was to flip polarity the contrast would be denoted by a relatively large and uniform dark region. Another concave nanomagnet 56 shown in a cutaway view has subdomain magnetization that is not fully uniform due to the magnetization attempting to align with a second magnetically easy axis denoted by a latitudinally aligned straight white arrow. Curved white arrows denote the magnetization of subdomains at either ends of the concave nanomagnet 56 due to configurational anisotropy. Note that a zipper-like pattern 58 forms when adjacent ones of the chain of concave nanomagnets 50 each have subdomain magnetization that is not substantially uniform. A concave nanomagnet such as the concave nanomagnet 54 is typically made up of a magnetic particle that has a width that ranges from around 120 nm to 180 nm. Moreover, concave nanomagnets such as the concave nanomagnet 54 typically have an aspect ratio (i.e., length/width) of around 2 to 3. Further confirmation of the intended behavior of concave nanomagnets was achieved by increasing the temperature of the nanomagnet chains while inside the PEEM chamber. FIG. 13 is a composite of PEEM micrographs that illustrates cascade-like signal dynamics that are attributable to configurational anisotropy. To verify that the horizontal magnetization of the concave nanomagnet chain 50 is in a metastable state rather than a global energy minimum state the temperature of the sample was raised to 120\u00b0 C. using a heating filament inside a sample stage of the PEEM chamber. The increase in thermal energy allows the each of the concave nanomagnets in the concave nanomagnet chain 50 to hop over the biaxial anisotropy energy barriers and permanently flip out of the metastable state. The final (i.e., bottom) magnetic contrast image shown in FIG. 13 confirms that the heated chain no longer remains locked along the horizontal axis and instead flips to the vertical axis, with anti-parallel nearest-neighbor alignment. This disclosure demonstrates the use of concave shapes to achieve tunable control of the anisotropy properties of nanomagnets for nanomagnetic logic applications. One of its key advantages over other means of anisotropy control is that it is induced by top-down lithography and can be fabricated using well-characterized processes like permalloy lift-off. Further exploration of the nanomagnet shape space in search of useful anisotropy properties will be fruitful for additional nanomagnetic applications. For example, a nanomagnet in which the easy axis is the same as the original convex shape but different in strength is also within the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, if a rectangle were to have concavities along its long edges rather than the short edges, the strength of the magnetically easy axis would be enhanced but not offset in direction. This could be useful for stabilizing magnetic memory devices, among other things. Concavity induced anisotropy offers a powerful new degree of freedom for controlling the anisotropy profile of nanoscale magnetic elements by top-down fabrication methods. Combined with conventional shape anisotropy, concavity induced anisotropy allows for broad control of both uniaxial and the biaxial anisotropy parameters in a single nanomagnet. This form of capability has important device applications in nanomagnetic logic, allowing for faster and more reliable computations than can be carried out with shape anisotropy alone. Further applications of concave nanomagnets might be found in future storage, memory, and biomedical devices. The present experimental investigation is focused on permalloy nanomagnets because they lack magneto crystalline anisotropy and they are relatively easy to fabricate using known integrated circuit manufacturing processes. However, it is to be understood that patterning concave nanomagnets made of materials with intrinsic anisotropy is within the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, concave nanomagnets made of materials with intrinsic anisotropy are likely to lead to potentially interesting superpositions of shape induced anisotropy and intrinsic anisotropy. Those skilled in the art will recognize improvements and modifications to the embodiments of the present invention. All such improvements and modifications are considered within the scope of the concepts disclosed herein and the claims that follow.",

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) ANISOTROPY ANALYSIS USING DIRECT AND REFLECTED ARRIVALS IN SEISMIC SURVEY DATA CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/807,567, entitled \"Optimizing VSP Anisotropy Surveys With Reflection Data,\" filed April 2, 2013, and incorporated herein by reference as is in its entirety. BACKGROUND Subsurface explorationists often employ seismic surveys to analyze subsurface structures. One particular type of seismic survey, Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP), combines the use of downhole seismic sensors with seismic sources on the surface. Often, the downhole seismic sensors are multi-component sensors spaced along a borehole to form a subsurface sensing array. The array may, in some cases, extend the entire length of the borehole, though it is more common to have the array limited to the region of interest and the vicinity thereof. (The sensors in this region generally exhibit the highest sensitivity to the desired formation parameters.) The structure of the subsurface is commonly characterized as a series of substantially horizontal layers. This characterization is not a requirement, but it is a useful starting point for an initial velocity model. The initial velocity model, often derived from independent sources (e.g., experience, borehole logs, educated guesswork) or extracted from the data using classical methods, is iteratively refined until it converges on a useful representation of the actual subsurface structure. This refining is often done by comparing the measured seismic wave arrival times with those predicted using the velocity model, and adapting the model in ways that gradually reduce any mismatches. It is common to consider not only the mismatches in first arrival times of seismic waves (so-called \"direct arrivals\" because they have taken the most direct path), but also the mismatches in later arrivals which result from seismic waves taking more indirect routes, e.g., by reflecting from acoustic impedance mismatches between strata (formation layers). To reduce the complexity of the solution process, the velocity model can, in some cases, be constrained. For example, the horizontal strata model assumption may be enforced, or the model may only be permitted to vary in the two-dimensional plane of the (inclined or deviated) borehole. Further, the velocity model may in some cases be limited to a fully isotropic velocity within each layer, though in the present disclosure the velocity of each layer is permitted to be anisotropic (transverse isotropy with a vertical symmetry axis). With the foregoing context, traditional VSP surveys may fail to fully exploit the anisotropy information that can be derived from reflected arrivals. Efforts to improve the accuracy and efficiency of VSP surveys are ongoing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Accordingly, there are disclosed herein techniques that invert direct and reflected arrivals in seismic survey data simultaneously to determine anisotropy parameters for at least one layer a vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) model.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Disclosed embodiments are directed to seismic data analysis systems and methods, where seismic receivers collect seismic survey data, including direct and reflected arrival data corresponding to shots from at least one source at different offsets. In at least some embodiments, an inversion is performed using the collected direct and reflected arrival data simultaneously to determine anisotropy parameters, including Thomsen parameters epsilon (\u03b5) and delta (\u03b4), for at least one layer of a vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) model. As described herein, reflected arrivals substantially increase traveltime sensitivity and provide supplemental data to the incidence angle range offered by the direct arrivals from a seismic source at a given shot location to a receiver. When reflected arrivals are taken into account, it becomes possible to improve survey efficiency by choosing a geometry with fewer shot locations that nevertheless offers data acquisition with the desired resolution and accuracy. Further, reflected arrivals have higher sensitivity to one or more anisotropy parameters of interest. Accordingly, the disclosed technique processes both direct arrival and reflected arrival data to determine a depth profile of anisotropic parameters. Simultaneous inversion of direct arrival data and reflected arrival data can provide better resolution for one or more of the anisotropy parameters than the direct arrivals alone. More specifically, the traveltime sensitivity of Thomsen parameters \u03b5 and \u03b4 varies as a function of incidence (or phase) angles. In the mid-angle range, traveltime is more sensitive to parameter \u03b4, whereas in the near-horizontal incidence angle region, traveltime is more sensitive to parameter \u03b5. If the two parameters are similar in magnitude, \u03b5 can be much more influential than \u03b4 and thus can be better resolved. Because the two Thomsen parameters have different influence ranges, surveying the key angle (or offset) range ensures better resolution of the parameters. If a full range of data is collected, proper weighting in the disclosed anisotropy analysis may reduce uncertainty in the estimation. Alternatively, the disclosed anisotropy analysis can be divided into two steps using long offsets for \u03b5 estimation and mid offsets for \u03b4 while \u03b5 retains the estimated value. Layer thickness tests indicate that the uncertainty of anisotropy parameters increases as layers become thinner and that the traveltime change resulting from anisotropy becomes comparable to other errors. Accordingly, adding reflected arrival data to the anisotropy analysis as described herein can help constrain the anisotropy estimation because reflected arrival data has increased traveltime sensitivity. The reflected arrival data can extend or fill in gaps in the vertical angle range covered by the direct arrivals. In accordance with at least some embodiments, pre-survey modeling identifies the maximum shot offset and key angle (or shot offset) range for the anisotropic parameters. Resolution and uncertainty of the anisotropy estimation depends on the selection of shot offset range, layer thickness, magnitude of anisotropy, and wave mode. Using reflected arrival data in conjunction with direct arrival traveltimes can reduce the uncertainty in anisotropy estimation, particularly for interval parameters in a layered medium. The disclosed systems and methods are best understood when described in an illustrative usage context. Accordingly, FIG. 1 shows one illustrative seismic survey environment, in which seismic receivers 102 are in a spaced-apart arrangement within a borehole 103 to detect seismic waves. As shown, the receivers 102 may be fixed in place by anchors 104 to facilitate sensing seismic waves. The environment of Fig. 1 is just one illustrative example. In different embodiments, the receivers 102 may be part of a logging- while-drilling (LWD) tool string or wireline logging tool string. Further, the receivers 102 communicate wirelessly or via cable to a data acquisition unit 106 at the surface 105, where the data acquisition unit 106 receives, processes, and stores seismic signal data collected by the receivers 102. Surveyors trigger a seismic energy source 108 (e.g., a vibrator truck) at one or more positions to generate seismic energy waves that propagate through the earth 1 10. Such waves refract through and reflect from acoustic impedance discontinuities to reach the receivers 102, which digitize and record the received seismic signals. The receivers 102 concurrently or in turn communicate their respective seismic signal data to the data acquisition unit 106, which stores the collected seismic signal data for later analysis to identify. Illustrative discontinuities include faults, boundaries between formation beds, and boundaries between formation fluids. The discontinuities may appear as bright spots in the subsurface structure representation that is derived from the seismic signal data. The illustrative subsurface model of FIG. 1 includes three relatively flat formation layers and two dipping formation layers of varying composition and hence varying speeds of seismic waves. Within each formation, the speed of seismic waves can be isotropic (i.e., the same in every direction) or anisotropic. Due to the layered structure of sedimentary rocks transverse isotropy is common in anisotropic formations. In other words the speed of seismic waves in anisotropic formations is the same in every \"horizontal\" direction, but is different for seismic waves traveling in the \"vertical\" direction. Note, however, that geologic activity can change formation orientations, turning a VTI formation into a tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) formation. In FIG. 1 , the third flat layer is VTI, while the first dipping formation layer is TTI. In at least some embodiments, the disclosed anisotropy analysis technique determines anisotropy parameters for a VTI model. The survey configuration of FIG. 1 corresponds to a vertical seismic profiling (VSP) survey configuration, where positions for surface source(s) and downhole receivers (e.g., as shown in example environment of FIG. 1) are used to interpret the collected seismic survey data. In alternative embodiments, a reverse VSP (RVSP) survey configuration may be employed, where positions for downhole source(s) and surface receivers are used to interpret the collected seismic survey data. Additionally or alternatively, VSP survey configurations, RVSP survey configurations, and/or cross-well survey configurations may be employed, where positions for downhole source(s) and downhole receivers are used to interpret collected seismic survey data. It should be appreciated that downhole source(s) may be above downhole receivers and/or below downhole receivers. Further, downhole source(s) and downhole receivers may be positioned in one borehole and/or in different boreholes. FIG. 2 shows a chart 120 with illustrative ray paths representing direct arrival data from different shot offsets. In chart 120, five horizontal layers (labeled 1 -5) are represented as well as direct arrival signals from 18 different shot offsets (e.g., a set of walkaway shots). FIG. 3 shows a chart 130 with illustrative ray paths representing reflected arrival data using the same offsets. In chart 130 of FIG. 3, the same five horizontal layers (labeled 1-5) shown in FIG. 2 are again represented as well as reflected arrival signals from 18 different shot offsets. Three of the direct arrival signals in chart 120 and three of the reflected arrival signals in chart 130 are bolded and are associated with a zero shot offset, a mid shot offset, and a far shot offset. In at least some embodiments, the zero shot offset, the mid shot offset, and the far shot offset correspond to a predetermined reduced shot configuration that provides arrival signals with sensitivity to the anisotropy parameters. Such sensitivity to the anisotropy parameters can be obtained with relatively few shots (e.g., 2 to 4 shots) if the arrival angles corresponding to the shots are sufficiently varied and include at least one wide arrival angle (e.g., 60 degrees or more). While the predetermined reduced shot configuration of charts 120 and 130 correspond to three shots at particular shot positions, it should be understood that the number of shots in a reduced shot configuration and/or their positions may vary. Further, charts 120 and 130 only illustrate direct arrival data and reflected arrival data for layer 5. Similar direct arrival data and reflected arrival data may be collected and/or plotted for each of the other illustrated layers in charts 120, 130 and/or other layers of a formation. It should be noted that while charts 120 and 130 correspond to a seismic survey configuration with surface source(s) and downhole receivers, other survey configurations are possible. FIG. 4 shows a chart 140 with illustrative direct and reflected arrival angle data (direct arrival angle data is represented as circles while the reflected arrival angle data is represented as triangles) as a function of shot offset. The arrival angles are measured from the vertical axis, though direct arrivals are measured relative to the upward direction and reflected arrivals are measured relative to the downward direction. The direct and reflected arrival angles shown in chart 140 correspond to signal arrivals for layer 5 in response to the shot offsets represented in charts 120 and 130. As shown, both the direct and reflected arrival angles for layer 5 increase as the shot offset increases. Similar direct and reflected arrival angle data may be collected and/or plotted for each of the layers 1-5 illustrated in charts 120, 130 and/or other layers of a formation. FIG. 5 shows a chart 150 with illustrative traveltime sensitivity data as a function of shot offset. The direct and reflected arrival traveltimes shown in chart 150 correspond to signal arrivals for layer 5 in response to the shot offsets represented in charts 120 and 130. In FIG. 5, traveltime sensitivities related to Thomsen parameters \u03b4 and \u03b5 are represented. More specifically, direct arrival traveltime sensitivities related to \u03b4 are represented as diamonds, reflected arrival traveltime sensitivities related to \u03b4 are represented as triangles, direct arrival traveltime sensitivities related to \u03b5 are represented as circles, and reflected arrival traveltime sensitivities related to \u03b4 are represented as squares. As shown, \u03b5 is more influential to far shot offsets than \u03b4. Also, \u03b5 is more influential to reflected arrivals than direct arrivals. Similar traveltime sensitivity data may be collected and/or plotted for each of the layers 1-5 illustrated in charts 120, 130 and/or other layers of a formation. The traveltime sensitivity for each anisotropic parameter is calculated numerically from a partial derivative of an anisotropic traveltime equation with respect to the anisotropic parameter at every phase angle or offset. FIG. 6 shows an illustrative flowchart of a seismic data analysis process 200. In process 200, data processing step 202 includes known seismic survey geometry operations, trace editing and stacking operations, direct and vertical rotation operations, arrival time re- pick operations, and quality control (QC) time pick and vertical angle operations. At least some of the results of the data processing step 202 are provided to anisotropy analysis block 206. The anisotropy analysis block 206 also receives as input a layered vertical velocity model 204. At block 206, various operations are performed to determine anisotropy parameters for each of a plurality of layers. In at least some embodiments, layer-based average anisotropy parameters are determined using a layer-stripping scheme. For each layer, an anisotropic effect is checked. For example, in at least some embodiments, the anisotropy effect may be checked by analyzing the traveltime contribution of each layer for evidence of anisotropy (e.g., by determining velocities associated with the contributions and searching for a dependence on incidence angle). If a layer is determined to be isotropic, the later steps to determine the anisotropy parameters may be omitted. Meanwhile, if evidence of anisotropy exists, angle coverage and traveltime sensitivity data is plotted for direct arrivals and reflected arrivals. For example, in at least some embodiments, traveltime sensitivity is plotted as a function of incidence angle and a weighting function is derived for the covered incidence angles. For example, in at least some embodiments, the weighting function is a series of positive scalers for individual data points, which are proportional to the sensitivity function and applied to the traveltime misfit function, to increase the influence of data with higher sensitivity in the inversion. Further, an inversion is performed to calculate best-fit anisotropy parameters using direct arrival traveltimes and reflected arrival traveltimes. In at least some embodiments, the layer-stripping scheme of block 206 assumes that the anisotropy throughout each layer is constant. For a VSP survey configuration, layer- stripping may involve working downward from the top layer and treating the velocity information for the layers above the given layer as fixed, such that the contribution of the given layer to the traveltimes for direct arrivals to receivers in the given layer are determined. Further, reflections from the bottom of the given layer to the receivers in and above the given layer are determined. For RVSP or cross-well survey configurations, the order of layer- stripping operations would vary depending on the position of the source(s) relative to the receivers. With the weighting function and angular dependence of the traveltimes, an inversion is performed to calculate the best-fit anisotropy parameters for the given layer. This inversion simultaneously accounts for the traveltime dependence of both direct arrivals and reflected arrivals on anisotropy. The inversion can employ any suitable inversion technique, including generalized inverse, and a grid search scheme. Once the inversion yields the parameters for the current layer, the offset and traveltime information for the next layer are adjusted accordingly. The process is repeated until the velocity model has been refined for all layers above and including the lowermost layer of interest. The velocity model resulting from the layer stripping-scheme may then be treated as an initial velocity model for a global inversion that constrains the anisotropy parameter values. In at least some embodiments, a tomographic ray-tracing inversion technique is then used to determine a globally optimal velocity model. The anisotropy parameters determined at block 206 are used to determine an anisotropy depth profile at block 208. FIG. 7 shows an illustrative seismic survey recording system having receivers 102 (see e.g., FIG. 1) coupled to a bus 402 to communicate digital signals to data recording circuitry 406. Position information sensors 404 (and optionally sensors for other parameters) are also coupled to the data recording circuitry 406 to enable the data recording circuitry to store additional information useful for interpreting the recorded data. For example, such additional information can include source waveform characteristics, digitization settings, detected faults in the system, etc. Recording circuitry 406 stores the high speed data stream(s) from receivers 102 to a nonvolatile storage medium such as a storage array of optical or magnetic disks. The data is stored in the form of (possibly compressed) seismic traces, each trace being the signal detected and sampled by a given receiver in response to a given shot. The associated shot and receiver positions are also stored. Illustrative seismic signals are shown in FIG. 8. The signals indicate some measure of seismic wave energy as a function of time (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration, pressure), and they are digitized at high resolution (e.g., 16 to 32 bits) at a programmable sampling rate (e.g., 400 to 1000 Hz) for a fixed duration after each shot (e.g., 30 seconds). Such signals can be grouped in different ways, and when so grouped, they are called a \"gather\". For example, a \"receiver gather\" is the group of traces that are acquired by a given receiver. A \"shot gather\" is the group of traces recorded for a single firing of the seismic source. A general purpose data processing system 408 receives the acquired seismic survey data from the data recording circuitry 406. In some cases the general purpose data processing system 408 is physically coupled to the data recording circuitry and provides a way to configure the recording circuitry and perform preliminary processing in the field. More typically, however, the general purpose data processing system is located at a central computing facility with adequate computing resources for intensive processing. The survey data can be transported to the central facility on physical media or communicated via a computer network. In at least some embodiments, the processing system 408 includes a user interface having a graphical display and a keyboard or other method of accepting user input and/or enabling users to view and analyze the subsurface structure images derived from collected seismic survey data. The recorded seismic survey data is of little use when maintained in the format of Fig. 7. Although it is possible to plot the various recorded waveforms side by side in a plot that reveals large scale subsurface structures, such structures are distorted and finer structures cannot even be seen. Hence the data is processed to create a data volume 502, i.e., a three dimensional array of data values such as that shown in FIG. 9. The data volume 502 represents some seismic attribute throughout the survey region. In some embodiments, the data volume 502 comprises uniformly- sized cells, each cell having a data value representing the seismic attribute for that cell. Various seismic attributes may be represented, and in some embodiments, each cell has multiple data values to represent multiple seismic attributes. Examples of suitable seismic attributes include reflectivity, acoustic impedance, acoustic velocity, anisotropy parameters, and density. The volumetric data format readily lends itself to computational analysis and visual rendering, and for this reason, the data volume of FIG. 9 may be termed a \"three-dimensional image\" of the survey region. Fig. 10 shows an illustrative computer system 600 for performing an inversion using collected direct and reflected arrival data to simultaneously determine anisotropy parameters for at least one layer a vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) model as described herein. In computer system 600, a personal workstation 602 is coupled via a local area network (LAN) 604 to one or more multi-processor computers 606, which are in turn coupled via the LAN to one or more shared storage units 608. Personal workstation 602 serves as a user interface to the processing system, enabling a user to load survey data into the system, to retrieve and view image data from the system, and to configure and monitor the operation of the processing system. Personal workstation 602 may take the form of a desktop computer with a graphical display that graphically shows survey data and images of the survey region, and with a keyboard that enables the user to move files and execute processing software. LAN 604 provides high-speed communication between multi-processor computers 606 and with personal workstation 602. The LAN 604 may take the form of an Ethernet network. Meanwhile, multi-processor computer(s) 606 provide parallel processing capability to enable suitably prompt conversion of seismic trace signals into a survey region image. Each computer 606 includes multiple processors 612, distributed memory 614, an internal bus 616, and a LAN interface 620. Each processor 612 operates on an allocated portion of the input data to produce a partial image of the seismic survey region. Associated with each processor 612 is a distributed memory module 614 that stores conversion software and a working data set for the processor's use. Internal bus 616 provides inter-processor communication and communication to the LAN networks via interface 620. Communication between processors in different computers 606 can be provided by LAN 604. Shared storage units 608 may be large, stand-alone information storage units that employ magnetic disk media for nonvolatile data storage. To improve data access speed and reliability, the shared storage units 608 may be configured as a redundant disk array. Shared storage units 608 initially store a velocity data volume and shot gathers from a seismic survey. The illumination matrix values and/or reflectivity image volumes can be stored on shared storage units 608 for later processing. In response to a request from the workstation 602, the image volume data can be retrieved by computers 606 and supplied to workstation for conversion to a graphical image to be displayed to a user. FIG. 11 shows an illustrative seismic analysis method 700. The method 700 may be performed at least in part by a computer system such as systems 408, and/or 600 described herein. In method 700, at least one source is triggered at different offsets (block 702). At block 704, direct and reflected arrival data for a seismic survey configuration is collected in response to the shots performed at block 702. As an example the direct and reflected arrival data may be collected by a plurality of downhole seismic receivers in response to shots from one or more seismic sources at earth's surface. Alternatively, the direct and reflected arrival data may be collected by a plurality of seismic receivers positioned at earth's surface in response to shots from one or more downhole seismic sources. Alternatively, the direct and reflected arrival data may be collected by a plurality of downhole seismic receivers in response to shots from one or more downhole seismic sources. At block 706, an inversion is performed using the collected direct and reflected arrival data simultaneously to determine anisotropy parameters for each of a plurality of layers of a VTI model. The inversion process of claim 706 may include various operations as described herein. In at least some embodiments, the inversion process includes determining average anisotropy parameters for each of a plurality of layers of the VTI model from top to bottom in a layer-stripping fashion. For each layer, the collected direct and reflected arrival data may be compared with modeled direct and reflected arrival data to determine an anisotropic effect before performing the inversion. Further, for each layer, angle coverage and traveltime sensitivities for the collected direct and reflected arrival data may be plotted, and a weighting function may be selected based on the plotted angle coverage and traveltime sensitivities. In at least some embodiments, the inversion process of step 706 includes performing a generalized inverse or a grid search scheme based on the weighting function and angular dependence of traveltimes. Further, a global optimization or generalized inversion may be employed to simultaneously constrain the anisotropy parameters for each of the plurality of layers of a VTI model. At block 708, a representation of a formation is displayed based on the inversion. For example, in at least some embodiments, the inversion process of block 706 outputs a layer- based anisotropy profile as a function of depth. Table 1 shows an example anisotropy profile as a function of depth. Table 1 Additionally or alternatively, the anisotropy profile output from the inversion process may provide uncertainty or error estimates; a number of iterations used; a comparison of anisotropy parameters resulting from inversion of direct arrival data, reflected arrival data, and/or both; a comparison of simulated versus measured anisotropy parameters; shot offset information; traveltime data; direct arrival angle data; reflected arrival angle data and/or related plots or charts. In at least some embodiments, the method 700 may include additional or alternative steps. For example, the method 700 may additionally include limiting the different shot offsets to a zero shot offset, a mid shot offset, and a far shot offset corresponding to predetermined key angles with traveltime sensitivity related to at least one of the anisotropy parameters. Further, the method 700 may additionally include selecting walkaway shot offsets including the different shot offsets based on a predetermined set of key angles with traveltime sensitivity related to at least one of the anisotropy parameters.

        "Description": "Description SUMMARY Various embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to a stack that is capable of magnetic data bit sensing. In accordance with some embodiments, a magnetic reader can have a non-magnetic spacer layer disposed between a magnetically free layer and a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) where the SAF is configured with an anisotropy tuned to a non-normal direction with respect to an air bearing surface (ABS).

FIG. 7 provides a flowchart of a magnetic reader fabrication routine carried out in accordance with various embodiments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Continuing emphasis for larger capacity, faster data storage devices has stressed the form factor in which data storage elements can be reliably manufactured and operated. One such data storage element is a magnetic data reader, which responds to data bits programmed on a data storage media to create a data signal. An increase in data bit density for storage media can elevate data capacity, but with the added consequence of inducing unwanted data signal amplitude loss and instability. Hence, industry is striving to provide magnetic data readers capable of providing increased data signal amplitude and stability in small form factor, increased data bit density data storage devices. Accordingly, a magnetic reader may have a non-magnetic spacer layer disposed between a magnetically free layer and a synthetic antiferromagnet, where the synthetic antiferromagnet is configured with an anisotropy tuned to a non-normal direction with respect to an air bearing surface. The ability to tune the anisotropy of portions of the magnetic reader can maintain magnetic stability and interaction between the synthetic antiferromagnet and the magnetically free layer, which can produce greater data signal amplitude while decreasing magnetic asymmetry. While a magnetic reader with tuned anisotropy can be practiced in a variety of non-limiting environments, FIG. 1 generally displays a data transducing portion 100 of a rotating data storage environment. The transducing portion 100 is configured with an actuating assembly 102 that positions a transducing head 104 over programmed data bits 106 present on a magnetic storage media 108 that is attached to, and rotates about, a spindle motor 110 to produce an air bearing surface (ABS) 112. The speed in which the spindle motor 110 rotates allows a slider portion 114 of the actuating assembly 102 to fly on the ABS to position a head gimbal assembly (HGA) 116, which includes the transducing head 104, over a desired portion of the media 108. The transducing head 104 can include one or more transducing elements, such as a magnetic writer and magnetically responsive reader, which operate to program data to and read data from the storage media 108, respectively. In this way, controlled motion of the actuating assembly 102 and spindle motor 110 can modulate the position of the transducing head both laterally along predetermined data tracks (not shown) defined on the storage media surfaces and vertically as measured perpendicularly to the media surface 114 to selectively write, read, and rewrite data. FIG. 2 shows a cross-sectional block representation of an example magnetic data reader 120 capable of being used in the transducing portion 100 of a data storage device shown in FIG. 1. While not required or limited to the configuration shown in FIG. 2, the magnetic reader 120 has a magnetic stack 122 disposed between electrode layers 124 and magnetic shields 126 on an air bearing surface (ABS). The magnetic stack 122 can be configured as a variety of different data bit sensing laminations, such as a magnetoresistive, tunnel magnetoresistive, and spin valve, but in some embodiments is constructed as a sensor with a magnetically free layer 128 and fixed magnetization reference structure 130 coupled to opposite sides of a non-magnetic spacer layer 132. The magnetic orientation of the free layer 128 and reference structure 130 acts to provide a measurable magnetoresistive effect when an external data bit is encountered. Various embodiments fix the magnetization of the reference structure 130 via connection with an antiferromagnetic layer. However, inclusion of such an antiferromagnetic layer can add to the shield-to-shield spacing 134 of the reader 120 which can provide difficulties in sensing data bits from reduced form factor data storage devices employing heightened data bit densities and reduced data track widths. With the removal of an antiferromagnetic layer from the magnetic stack 122, the reader's shield-to-shield spacing 134 can be reduced, but at the cost of introducing magnetic instability as the reference structure 130 may be left unsupported, which can correspond with magnetization tilting and asymmetry resulting in overall data signal amplitude loss. Configuring the free layer 128 with a magnetization direction that differs from the reference structure 130 may compensate for adverse effects resulting from the removal of an antiferromagnetic layer by stabilizing magnetizations in both the reference structure 130 and free layer 128. Setting the magnetization direction of the various layers in the reader 120 can be accomplished in several different, non-limiting, manners such as by setting the intrinsic anisotropy of the reference structure 130 and free layer 128 to provide magnetization directions that are perpendicular and parallel to an air bearing surface (ABS) of the reader 120, respectively. More specifically, the free layer 128 may be formed with an intrinsic anisotropy that maintains bipolar magnetization in a plane aligned along the Z-axis while a reference layer 136 and pinned layer 138 of the reference structure 130 are formed with intrinsic anisotropies that align the fixed magnetizations respectively along the X-axis. With the magnetizations of the reference and pinned layers 136 and 138 antiferromagnetically coupling across a SAF spacer layer 140 and being out of phase with the magnetization of the free layer 128, magnetic stability of the reader may be optimized to decrease magnetic asymmetry and increase data signal amplitude. The ability to tune the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetic stack 122 layers may combine with the tuning of the size of the reference structure 130 and free layer 128 to optimize the reader's 120 performance to accommodate various environmental conditions, such as data bit density and data readback rate. FIG. 3 displays a block representation of a cross-section of an example magnetic stack 150 tuned in a variety of manners to provide predetermined data sensing performance. As shown, the magnetic stack 150 is configured as a lamination of layers each having a predetermined stripe height 152 measured from the ABS along the X-axis. Various embodiments can tune the stripe height 152 of one or more of the free 154, reference 156, and pinned 158 layers individually or collectively to produce multiple different stripe heights 152 for the magnetic stack. Regardless of whether the stripe height 152 is tuned in any way, each of the magnetic stack 150 layers can be optimized for thickness, as measured along the Y-axis. For example, the free layer 154 can be tuned to a first predetermined thickness 160 that differs from second and third predetermined thicknesses 162 and 164 corresponding to the reference 156 and pinned 158 layers, respectively. In some embodiments, the reference 156 and pinned 158 layers are tuned in view of the overall thickness of the reference structure 166 that includes the SAF spacer layer 168 to balance the magnetizations of the respective layers with respect to the tuned anisotropy strengths and directions. That is, the predetermined thicknesses 162 and 164 of the reference 156 and pinned 158 layers, such as 2.6 nm and 3.1 nm respectively, can be chosen in relation to the intrinsic anisotropy, such as 400 Oe, of each layer 156 and 158 to balance magnetic asymmetry and provide magnetic stability despite the lack of an antiferromagnetic layer being present in the stack 150. Tuning the thicknesses 160, 162, and 164 and stripe height 152 of the respective magnetic stack 150 layers can be done in isolation or in combination with tuning the intrinsic anisotropy of one or more of the layers. FIGS. 4 and 5 each generally illustrate block top view representations of example layers 180, 190, and 200 each capable of being used in a magnetic stack, such as magnetic stack 122 of FIG. 2. Layer 180 shows how the intrinsic anisotropy can be constructed with a magnetization direction 182 that is parallel to the ABS and the Y-axis while layer 190 displays how the magnetization direction 192 can be oriented along the X-axis, perpendicular to the ABS. While the orientation of various layers in the same magnetic stack may be tuned with intrinsic anisotropies causing magnetization directions that are normal, parallel or perpendicular, to the ABS, tuning the magnetization direction to a non-normal orientation 202, as displayed by layer 200, can increase data signal amplitude, especially when paired with other magnetic stack layers optimized for thickness and anisotropic strength. It should be noted that the term \u0093non-normal\u0094 will be understood to describe an angular orientation not equaling zero or ninety degrees. It is to further be understood that the manner in which the intrinsic anisotropy and magnetization directions are constructed are not limited to a particular process and may be formed and tuned in a variety of different means. As a non-limiting example, the azimuth angle of grazed oblique deposition onto a seed layer can be used to create tuned intrinsic anisotropy corresponding to a 150 degree non-normal magnetization direction, as generally shown by magnetization 202 in layer 200 of FIG. 4 and more specifically by the magnetizations of layers displayed in FIG. 5. A review of FIG. 5 reveals how the non-normal magnetization direction of layer 200 can provide a more uniform magnetization profile throughout the layer than the normal magnetization directions of layers 180 and 190. No matter how the intrinsic anisotropy and magnetization direction are formed, the tuning of a non-normal magnetization direction can be done for magnetic stack layers individually or collectively, which can precisely optimize magnetic stack performance as illustrated by the data of FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, the effects of different magnetization directions are graphed in relation to data signal amplitude for a 200 Oe intrinsic anisotropy by solid line 210 and for a 400 Oe intrinsic anisotropy by segmented line 212. With the data from lines 210 and 212, a magnetic stack, and specifically the reference structure of a magnetic reader, can be tuned and optimized to produce data signal amplitudes conducive to various small form factor data storage environments. A tuned embodiment resulting from the data of FIG. 6 may configure pinned and reference layers of a reference structure each with 400 Oe intrinsic anisotropies and 150 degree non-normal magnetization directions to produce roughly a 131% data signal amplitude, which contrasts sharply with a magnetic stack having non-tuned anisotropy and no antiferromagnetic layer to support the magnetization of the reference structure. The combination of the tuned intrinsic anisotropy direction and magnitude with the tuned thickness and stripe height can provide optimized magnetization asymmetry and stability that allows for relaxed anisotropy amplitude with lower shield-to-shield spacing in addition to greater data signal amplitude. FIG. 7 provides an example flowchart of a reader fabrication routine 220 that maps how a magnetic stack can be tuned in accordance with various embodiments. The routine 220 may initially deposit a magnetic shield and electrode on a substrate in step 222. The electrode layer can extend from an air bearing surface to a stripe height that is less than or equal to the stripe height of the shield and, in some embodiments, can be configured as a seed layer with material and surface roughness conducive to producing intrinsic anisotropy in a subsequently deposited layer. Step 224 then forms a pinned layer on the electrode layer that has a predetermined intrinsic anisotropy magnitude and direction with respect to the air bearing surface. A SAF spacer layer is subsequently deposited on the pinned layer in step 226 to provide antiferromagnetic coupling between a reference layer and the pinned layer as well as providing a potential seed layer for constructing the reference layer with predetermined intrinsic anisotropy in step 228. That is, the SAF spacer layer formed in step 226 may have a thickness and non-magnetic material that provides antiferromagnetic coupling and a substrate that may be roughed as a seed layer to aid in producing the intrinsic anisotropy of the reference layer in step 228 with a second magnitude and direction that may be the same, or differ, from the anisotropic magnitude and direction in the pinned layer. With the formation of the reference layer completing the construction of the fixed magnetization reference structure, step 230 deposits a non-magnetic spacer layer atop the reference layer with a thickness allowing data sensing between the magnetization of the free layer and the reference structure. Various embodiments next form a magnetically free layer on the non-magnetic spacer layer in step 232 with a third intrinsic anisotropy that has different magnitude and direction than the anisotropy of both the reference and pinned layers. Formation of the magnetically free layer in step 232 is then followed by the deposition of a top electrode and shield in step 234. It should be mentioned that while routine 220 successively deposits layers in a particular sequence, such sequence is not required or limiting as the magnetic stack can comprise any number and orientation of layers. For example, the magnetically free layer may be formed before the reference and pinned layers of the reference structure so that the magnetic stack is flipped in comparison to a stack produced from routine 220. With the ability to tune the various magnetic stack layers by optimizing the intrinsic anisotropy to produce predetermined magnetization directions and magnitudes, the magnetic operation of the magnetic stack can be tailored to provide predetermined ratios of magnetic stability, data signal amplitude, and magnetic asymmetry. The routine 220, however, is not limited only to the steps and decisions provided in FIG. 7 as any number of steps can be added, omitted, and modified to accommodate the fabrication of a precisely tuned magnetic reader. It can be appreciated that the configuration and material characteristics of the magnetic reader described in the present disclosure allows for tuned data sensing conducive to high data bit density, small form factor data storage devices. The ability to tune portions of a magnetic stack with a differing anisotropies and magnetization directions may provide increased magnetic stability and reduced asymmetry that promotes higher data signal amplitude. Moreover, the utilization of non-normal intrinsic anisotropy in at least the reference structure of a magnetic stack can provide enough magnetic stability to remove an antiferromagnetic layer and reduce the overall physical size of the magnetic stack. Additionally, while the embodiments have been directed to magnetic sensing, it will be appreciated that the claimed invention can readily be utilized in any number of other applications, including data storage device applications. It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and configurations of various embodiments of the present disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments, this detailed description is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangements of parts within the principles of the technology to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the particular elements may vary depending on the particular application without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.",

        "Description": "Description CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is based on, and claims priority from, Taiwan Application Serial Number 101139633, filed on Oct. 26, 2012, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety TECHNICAL FIELD The technical field relates to a liquid-crystal compound, and in particular relates to a synthesis and an application of a liquid-crystal compound with negative dielectric anisotropy. BACKGROUND Liquid-crystal displays (hereinafter LCD) based on the twisted nematic (hereinafter TN) mode is the most common type of flat panel display (hereinafter FPD). The conventional TN LCD utilized in wristwatches or desk calculators can only contain a small number of matrix segments (e.g. 8*8), and therefore cannot be applied in displays with high information content, such as thin-film transistor (TFT) LCDs, which actively switch a large number of segments (e.g. 1024*768). Nevertheless, despite performance improvements for TFT LCDs, conventional TN LCDs still hold advantages such as a lighter weight, smaller volume requirement, and lower power consumption. In the 1990s Based on the combination of liquid-crystal and TFT, notebook computers became prevalent since the beginning of the 1990s, and development of the electronics and materials thereof continues even now. The prerequisite for liquid crystals is a broad nematic phase range of \u221240 to 100\u00b0 C. in order to guarantee the so-called operating temperature range of LCDs. The clearing point of a liquid crystal is the temperature at which the liquid-crystal phase vanishes. The clearing point must be at least 10\u00b0 C. higher than the operating temperature of the device. The liquid-crystal molecule can be operated in a display device. After having voltage applied, the liquid-crystal molecule switches to a perpendicular orientation, or their original direction, due to dielectric anisotropy. For example, after the positive dielectric anisotropic liquid-crystal (utilized in general TN mode or IPS mode devices) has a driving voltage applied, the molecular long axis thereof will be influenced by and run parallel to the electric field. Contrary to the positive dielectric anisotropic liquid crystal, after the negative dielectric anisotropic liquid-crystal (utilized in VA mode devices) has a driving voltage applied, the molecular long axis thereof will be perpendicular to the electric field. In addition, the liquid-crystal formula should be highly stable under UV exposure. For achieving the above requirements, several papers and patents disclose liquid-crystal molecule designs. However, a novel liquid-crystal molecule with negative dielectric anisotropy is still desired for being highly stable under UV exposure.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to a magnetic device that utilizes thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and a method for making the same, and in particular, to decreasing the Ho field from a reference layer on a free layer while increasing He and thermal stability in the resulting multilayer magnetic stack with a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer having enhanced RKKY coupling. BACKGROUND Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), based on the integration of silicon CMOS with MTJ technology, is a major emerging technology that is highly competitive with existing semiconductor memories such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash. Similarly, spin-transfer (spin torque or STT) magnetization switching described by C. Slonczewski in \"Current driven excitation of magnetic multilayers\", J. Magn. Magn. Mater. V 159, L1-L7 (1996), has recently stimulated considerable interest due to its potential application for spintronic devices such as STT-MRAM on a gigabit scale. J-G. Zhu et al. has described another spintronic device called a spin transfer oscillator (STO) in \"Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording\", IEEE Trans, on Magnetics, Vol. 44, No. 1 , pp. 125-131 (2008) where a spin transfer momentum effect is relied upon to enable recording at a head field significantly below the medium coercivity in a perpendicular recording geometry. The STO comprises a stack including a spin injection layer (SIL) with PMA character, an oscillating field generation layer (FGL) with in-plane anisotropy, and a spacer between the SIL and FGL. Both MRAM and STT-MRAM may have a MTJ element based on a tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect wherein a stack of layers has a configuration in which two ferromagnetic iayers typically referred to as a reference layer and free layer are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer. The MTJ element is typically formed between a bottom electrode such as a first conductive line and a top electrode which is a second conductive line at locations where the top electrode crosses over the bottom electrode in a MRAM device. In another aspect, a MTJ element in a read head sensor may be based on a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect that relates to a spin valve structure where a reference layer and free layer are separated by a metal spacer. In sensor structures, the MTJ is formed between two shields and there is a hard bias layer adjacent to the MTJ element to provide longitudinal biasing for stabilizing the free layer magnetization. In a MTJ within a MRAM or STT-MRAM, a reference layer will usually exert a stray magnetic field upon the free layer that tends to favor either the P or AP state. The stray \"offset\" field (Ho) has a form similar to a non-uniform electric \"fringing\" field at the edges of a parallel plate capacitor. As depicted in FIG. 1 , the stray field (Ho) 4 from reference layer 1 impinges on the free layer 3. Note that a dielectric spacer 2 such as a tunnel barrier layer separates the free layer and reference layer. When reference layer 1 is a composite, the net stray field 4 will be the sum of fringing fields from several similar layers in the reference layer stack with the possible addition of a uniform effective \"interiayer\" coupling field. The free layer is subject to random thermal agitation and the stray field will create a disparity in the thermal stability of the two states, with either the P or AP state rendered more thermally stable. This asymmetry is undesirable since for a given free layer coercivity (He), Ho should be zero for optimum stability. Generally, Ho = 0 is difficult to achieve in practice, and as a rule, Ho < 15% of He is a reasonable target in actual devices. Materials with PMA are of particular importance for magnetic and magnetic- optic recording applications. Spintronic devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have an advantage over MRAM devices based on in-plane anisotropy in that they can satisfy the thermal stability requirement and have a low switching current density but also have no limit of cell aspect ratio. As a result, spin valve structures based on PMA are capable of scaling for higher packing density which is one of the key challenges for future MRAM applications and spintronic devices. When the size of a memory cell is reduced, much larger magnetic anisotropy is required because the thermal stability factor is proportional to the volume of the memory cell. Generally, PMA materials have magnetic anisotropy larger than that of conventional in-plane soft magnetic materials which utilize shape anisotropy. Thus, magnetic devices with PMA are advantageous for achieving low switching current and high thermal stability. For spin torque applications, a free layer with high He and low offset field (Ho) is required. In addition, the free layer preferably has a high energy barrier Eb = KUV/KBT where Ku is the magnetic anisotropy, V is the switching magnetic volume, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the measurement temperature. A SAF free layer has been employed with a coupling layer (spacer) formed between two ferromagnetic layers (FL1 and FL2) having PMA in opposite directions in order to reduce coupling between a free layer and reference layer in a MTJ stack. Several PMA material systems for FL1 and FL2 include various ordered (i.e. L10) alloys, unordered alloys, and laminates represented by (Pt Fe)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Ni/Co)n, and the like, where n is the lamination number. Magnetization direction for FL1 and FL2 is anti-parallel due to the RKKY coupling through a metal spacer. There is a big challenge to increase the RKKY (anti-ferromagnetic) coupling strength to enhance magnetic stability and thermal stability of the free layer to be compatible with semiconductor processes that reach as high as 400\u00b0C or higher. A higher annealing temperature of >350\u00b0C is also useful in achieving an enhanced TMR ratio. None of existing technology is known to provide low Ho with high He and a Kb value approaching 70 for thermal stability in a PMA layer that will withstand high temperature processing up to 400\u00b0C or greater which is required in fabrication methods. Therefore, a low cost multilayer stack with high PMA, high He, low Ho, and improved thermal stability is needed to enable PMA materials to be more widely accepted in a variety of magnetic device applications. SUMMARY One objective of the present disclosure is to provide a SAF free layer with PMA in MTJ stack in a magnetic device that has an Eb value greater than at least 70 and a low offset field (Ho) less than 100 Oe that is suitable for spintronic applications such as spin-torque MRAM (STT-MRAM), and microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR). A second objective of the present disclosure is to provide a MTJ element with a SAF free layer having a magnetic coercivity (He) substantially greater than the Ho field to enable improved stability of the P or AP magnetic state in the free layer. According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, these objectives are achieved by sequentially forming a reference layer, tunnel barrier layer, SAF free layer, and capping layer on a substrate wherein the SAF free layer has a FL1 /dusting layer 1 /coupling layer/dusting layer 2/FL2 configuration in which the FL1 and FL2 ferromagnetic layers have PMA character, the coupling layer is Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Mo, or other metals that induce RKKY or antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers, and the DL1 , DL2 dusting layers enhance the RKKY coupling. The substrate may be a seed layer that is one or more of NiCr, NiFeCr, Mg, Ta, TaN, Ti, Ru, or other materials that maintain or enhance PMA in an overlying reference layer. In one aspect, FL1 and FL2 are laminates such as (Ni/Co)n, (Pt/Co)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Co/Ru)n, and the like where n is the lamination number which is from 1 to 10, and preferably 1 to 4. However, Co may be replaced by a Co-rich alloy such as CoFe or CoFeB wherein Co content is greater than that of Fe or B, and Ni may be replaced by a Ni rich alloy such as NiFe or NiFeB. In an alternative embodiment, FL1 and FL2 are L10 ordered alloys including FePt, CoPt, and FePd. In yet another embodiment, FL1 and FL2 may be rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) films such as TbFeCo, GdFeCo, and the like. When a high MR ratio is preferred, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be comprised of CoFeB or CoNiFeB. A key feature is the dusting layer formed on top and bottom surfaces of the middle spacer that enhances antiferromagnetic coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers. The dusting layer has a thickness between 1 and 50 Angstroms, and preferably from 1 to 10 Angstroms, and is made of Co, Fe, Ni, NiFe, or a CoxFeyNiz alloy wherein x, y, and z are the atomic % of Co, Fe, and Ni, respectively. The dusting layers may be deposited at room temperature or at an elevated temperature up to 400\u00b0C. Subsequently, annealing up to 400\u00b0C or higher, and preferably 350\u00b0C, may be employed to further improve P A properties and thereby increase He and Hk in the free layer. In a first embodiment that represents a bottom spin valve configuration, a seed layer, reference layer, tunnel barrier layer, SAF free layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The reference layer may be a composite with a SAF configuration represented by AP2/coupling layer/API where AP1 and AP2 are antiparallel coupled ferromagnetic layers, or by RL1/DL5/coupling layer/ DL6/RL2 configuration wherein RL1 and RL2 are first and second reference layers with PMA that have a laminated structure, an L1o ordered composition, or are made of a RE-TM film as described previously, and DL5 and DL6 are dusting layers formed on top and bottom surfaces of a coupling layer. The SAF free layer preferably has the FL1/DL1 /coupling layer/DL2/FL2 structure described previously. In a STO embodiment, the SAF reference layer serves as the field generation layer (FGL) in a MAMR structure while the SAF free layer functions as a spin injection layer (SIL). The present disclosure also encompasses an embodiment where the MTJ element has a top spin valve configuration in a STT-MRAM scheme represented by seed layer/SAF free layer/tunnel barrier/reference layer/capping layer wherein the SAF free layer has a FL1/DL2/coupling layer/DL1/FL2 design with the FL1 layer contacting the seed layer. The reference layer may have a SAF configuration that is represented by RL1/DL5/coupling layer/DL6/RL2 where RL1 and RL2 are selected from the same PMA materials as FL1 and FL2, and DL5 and DL6 are selected from the same dusting layer materials as DL1 and DL2. The coupling layer is a non-magnetic material such as Ru or Mo, for example. According to a third embodiment, there may be a transitional layer made of CoFeB/Co or the like inserted between the SAF FL2 layer and tunnel barrier layer in a top spin valve configuration. In a bottom spin valve configuration with a SAF reference layer having PMA, the transitional layer may be inserted between the RL2 layer and the tunnel barrier layer. In all embodiments, we observe that a substantial coercivity (He) and RKKY exchange coupling strength is maintained even after annealing at 400\u00b0C for one hour. A dual SAF free layer structure may be used to further improve He and thermal stability and has a FL1/DL1 /coupling layer1/DL2/FL2/DL3/coupling layer 2/DL4/FL3 configuration where the FL1 layer contacts a tunnel barrier layer and the FL3 layer interfaces with a capping layer in a bottom spin valve MTJ stack. In yet another embodiment, the coupling layer thickness in a FL1/DL1 /coupling layer/DL2/FL2 scheme may be modified to yield a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) free layer that is an alternative to a single free layer because of higher magnetic volume in the SyF structure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure is a multilayer stack with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and enhanced RKKY coupling that may be employed as a reference layer, free layer, or dipole layer in magnetic devices such as MRAM and STT- MRAM, in spintronic devices such as MAMR, in various designs of PMA spin valves including MTJ elements, and in PMA magnetic media used in magnetic sensors and data storage. Although the exemplary embodiments depict a bottom spin valve or a top spin valve structure, the present disclosure also applies to dual spin valve designs as appreciated by those skilled in the art. A non-magnetic spacer that serves as an antiferromagnetic coupling layer in SAF structures described herein is hereafter mentioned simply as \"coupling layer\" to avoid confusion with the non-magnetic spacer formed between the free layer and reference layer in the MTJ stacks of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 2, the most basic representation of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) layer of the present disclosure is depicted as a SAF free layer 30 with a FL1/DL1 /coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration that is formed on a substrate such as a non-magnetic layer (spacer) 29 which may be a tunnel barrier layer that is comprised of a dielectric material including one or more of MgO, AIOx, TiOx, ZnO, or other metal oxides or metal nitrides in a tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) scheme, for example. Alternatively, the non-magnetic spacer may be comprised of Cu or another high conductivity metal or metal alloy in a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) embodiment. The present disclosure also anticipates a GMR embodiment wherein spacer 29 has a current confining path (CCP) structure in which a dielectric layer with metal paths therein is sandwiched between two metal layers (i.e. Cu) as appreciated by those skilled in the art. The planes of the layers illustrated in all embodiments are in a (x, y) plane and each layer has a thickness in the z-axis direction. SAF free layer 30 is a composite with a lower ferromagnetic layer (FL1 ) 31 and an uppermost ferromagnetic layer (FL2) 35, and each of FL1 and FL2 has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) that may be intrinsic or induced through an interface with an oxide layer, for example. In a preferred embodiment, there is a coupling layer 33 that induces RKKY coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers, and there are first and second dusting layers DL1 32, DL2 34, respectively, that enhance the aforementioned RKKY coupling. Thus, FL1 layer 31 has a magnetization 52 aligned in a (+) z-axis direction and FL2 layer 35 has a magnetization 51 aligned in an opposite direction to that of FL1 . In an alternative magnetic state, the directions of magnetizations 51, 52 are reversed with respect to the arrows shown in FIG. 2. Layers 31-35 may be sequentially sputter deposited on the non-magnetic layer 29. Thus, DL1 adjoins a top surface of FL1 31 and interfaces with a bottom surface of coupling layer 33 while DL2 interfaces with a top surface of the coupling layer and adjoins a bottom surface of FL2 35. FL1 and FL2 layers 31, 35 may be a laminated structure such as (Co/Ni)n, (Co/Pd)n, (Co/Pt)n, (Co/Ru)n, or other laminated stacks exhibiting intrinsic PMA where n is between 1 and 10, and preferably from 1 to 4. It should be understood that the aforementioned laminated stacks may also be represented by (Ni/Co)n, (Pd/Co)n, (Pt/Co)n, and (Ru/Co)n, respectively, depending on which of the metal layers is deposited first. The present disclosure also anticipates that one or more of the laminated layers may be a Co-based alloy such as CoFe or CoFeB as a replacement for Co, and a Ni-based alloy such as NiCo, NiFe, or NiFeB may be a replacement for Ni. Preferably, the Co-based alloy is Co rich wherein the Co content is > 50 atomic%, and the Ni-based alloy is Ni rich wherein the Ni content is > 50 atomic%. Thus, (CoFe/Ni)n, (CoFeB/Ni)n, (Co/NiFe)n, (Co/NiFeB)n, and (NiCo/Co)n are alternatives for FL1 and FL2 layers. Typically, the Co or Co alloy layer in the laminates has a thickness between 0.5 and 5 Angstroms while the Pd, Pt, Ni, or Ni alloy layer has a thickness from 2 to 10 Angstroms. Note that FL1 and FL2 layers may have the same composition or may be made of different laminated stacks. Furthermore, the number of laminations in the FL1 layer 31 may differ from the number of laminations in the FL2 layer 35. Typically, as the number \"n\" of laminations increases, PMA within the laminated layer increases. However, the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio for a laminated layer such as (Co/Ni)n is generally less than observed for a CoFe or CoFeB layer. In another embodiment, one or both of FL1 layer 31 and FL2 layer 35 are comprised of L10 ordered alloys such as FePt, CoPt, FePd, NiPt, FeNi, FeCu, MnAI, MnPt, MnPd, CuAu, and the like that have PMA character. In this case, FL1 and FL2 layers each have a thickness from 15 to 150 Angstroms. In yet another embodiment, FL1 and FL2 layers may be made of rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) films including TbFeCo, GdFeCo, and the like that exhibit PMA. The present disclosure also anticipates that one of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be one of the aforementioned laminates, L10 alloy, or a RE-TM alloy while the other of the FL1 or FL2 layers is another of the laminates, L10 alloy, or a RE-TM alloy. In yet another embodiment, one or both of the FLIand FL2 layers is made of an alloy such as CoFeB or CoNiFeB that has PMA because interfacial perpendicular anisotropy is established as a result of an interface with an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride layer. For instance, when FL1 31 is CoFeB or CoNiFeB and interfaces with a non-magnetic spacer 29 that is a tunnel barrier comprised of MgO or the like, then PMA is generated in a FL1 layer having a thickness from 5 to 20 Angstroms. Likewise, when FL2 35 is CoFeB or CoNiFeB and interfaces with a capping layer (FIG. 3) made of an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride, then PMA is generated in a FL2 layer with a thickness from 5 to 20 Angstroms. The coupling layer 33 is one of Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Ir, Mo, or other metals capable of inducing RKKY coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers 21, 25. Ru is often selected as the coupling layer because a higher coupling strength is achieved with a FL1/DL1/Ru/DL2/FL2 configuration when DL1 and DL2 are Co dusting layers. However, we have found that other coupling layers such as Mo when used with a Fe dusting layer will generate a RKKY coupling strength equal to greater than that provided by a Ru coupling layer and Co dusting layers. According to the present disclosure, the thickness of the metal coupling layer is between 2 and 20 Angstroms with 4 or 9 Angstroms being preferred since either of these thicknesses will lead to the largest RKKY anti-parallel coupling strength in a FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration. Note that 13 Angstroms is another coupling layer thickness that produces significant anti- parallel coupling strength. As explained later, an intermediate coupling layer thickness of 6 Angstroms or a coupling layer thickness less than 3 Angstroms may be selected to establish a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) structure using the same stack of layers 31-35. D1 layer 32 and D2 layer 34 are referred to as dusting layers and have a thickness between 1 and 50 Angstroms, and preferably from 1 to 10 Angstroms. The dusting layers are made of Co, Fe, Ni, or an alloy thereof such as CoFeNi or NiFe. We have found that inserting a first dusting layer between coupling layer 33 and FL1 layer 31, and a second dusting layer between the coupling layer and FL2 layer 35 provides an advantage in substantially enhancing the RKKY coupling strength thereby improving thermal stability of SAF free layer 30. Furthermore, a subsequent anneal up to 400\u00b0C, and preferably at about 350\u00b0C, after all layers in the SAF free layer stack are deposited, may be employed to further improve PMA properties by increasing He and Hk. DL1 layer 32 and DL2 layer 34 may be sputter deposited at room temperature (RT) or at elevated temperatures up to 400\u00b0C or even higher. With dusting layer thicknesses greater than about 15 Angstroms, layers 31 , 35 may have a canted magnetization angle where the magnetic moments 51 , 52 are between 0 and 90 degrees with respect to the planes of the layers in the SAF free layer stack. In this case, a smaller PMA is achieved in the SAF free layer stack than with thinner DL1 and DL2 layers. The present disclosure also encompasses an embodiment wherein only one dusting layer 32 or 34 is employed in a SAF structure. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate there is a substantial benefit in terms of higher RKKY coupling and greater thermal stability when using both dusting layers rather than only one. Referring to FIG. 3, a second embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted and shows a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack wherein a seed layer 15, SAF reference layer 20, non-magnetic spacer 29, SAF free layer 30, and a capping layer 40 are sequentially formed on a substrate 10. The present disclosure also anticipates that an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer (not shown) may be inserted between the seed layer and SAF reference layer to pin the magnetization direction of an adjoining AP2 layer in a SAF reference layer that has an AP2/coupling/AP1 configuration. The substrate may be a bottom electrode in a STT-MRAM, a main pole in a STO, or a bottom shield in a TMR sensor, for example. A seed layer 15 is selected that is comprised of one or more of NiCr, NiFeCr, Ta, TaN, Mg, Ru or other metals or alloys to maintain or enhance PMA, He, and Hk in overlying magnetic layers. In one aspect, the reference layer has a SAF structure with an antiferromagnetic coupling layer 22 made of Ru, Cu, Cr, Rh, Ir, or Mo sandwiched between AP2 and AP1 ferromagnetic layers. Preferably, AP1 layer 23 that adjoins a bottom surface of the non-magnetic spacer (tunnel barrier) 29 has PMA that is aligned in a direction parallel or anti-parallel to magnetization 52 in FL1 layer 31. PMA in AP1 layer 23 may be induced through an interface with the tunnel barrier. In one aspect, the AP1 layer may be comprised of CoFeB or CoFeB/Co. The AP2 layer 21 may be comprised of CoFe or the like with an in-plane magnetization. The capping layer 40 formed on the SAF free layer 30 may be comprised of one or more non-magnetic metals including Ta, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Hf, Pt, Pd, W, Nb, Rh, Ru, Cu, Cr, Os, and Ir. Optionally, the capping layer is comprised of a dielectric material that is a metal oxide or an oxide of a metal alloy including MgTaOx, MgO, MgZrOx, SiOx, SrTiOx, BaTiOx, CaTiOx, LaAIOx, MnOx, VOx, AI2O3, TiOx, BOx, ZrOx, and HfOx. Preferably, capping layer 40 is made of MgTaOx wherein the Mg:Ta ratio is from about 2:1 to 1 :1. Moreover, the capping layer may be comprised of a lamination of one or more of the aforementioned oxides. Referring to FIG. 4, a third embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated and retains the same features as the second embodiment except the AP2 layer 21a and AP1 layer 23a in the SAF reference layer 20 exhibit intrinsic PMA and may be comprised of the same laminated stack, L10 ordered alloy, or RE-TM film as previously described with respect to FL1 and FL2 layers 31 , 35. Thus, the third embodiment has a bottom spin valve configuration wherein a seed layer, AP2 layer with PMA, coupling layer, AP1 layer with PMA, non-magnetic spacer, SAF free layer, and capping layer are consecutively formed on a substrate. According to a fourth embodiment in FIG. 5, the MTJ stack of layers retains the same layers as in FIG. 4 except the reference layer, now designated as SAF reference layer 25, further includes an uppermost transition layer 24 between the AP1 layer 23a and non-magnetic spacer 29. The transition layer may be comprised of CoNiFeB, CoFeB, CoFe, Co, or composites thereof such as CoFeB/Co. In a preferred embodiment, the transition layer is formed between a (111 ) AP1 layer with PMA and a (100) MgO tunnel barrier, and is sufficiently thin to preserve the PMA property of layer 23a and yet thick enough to provide a high magnetoresistance (MR ratio). Thus, in a CoFeB/Co transitional layer 24, the CoFeB portion may be from 4 to 15 Angstroms thick, and preferably 6 Angstroms, while the Co layer portion is from 3 to 8 Angstroms, and preferably 4 Angstroms thick. Co may be used as the uppermost layer in the reference layer stack and the interface with the tunnel barrier layer since it is more resistant to oxidation than a CoFeB (or CoFe) layer. In other words, in a conventional MTJ, oxygen can migrate out of a MgO tunnel barrier layer into a reference layer thereby causing partial oxidation of CoFeB or the like, which leads to a degradation in the MR ratio. Referring to FIG. 6, a SAF free layer structure of the present disclosure may be incorporated in a MAMR embodiment wherein a spin torque oscillator (STO) structure is formed between two terminals. In the exemplary embodiment that depicts a portion of a perpendicular magnetic writer, the substrate 10 is a main pole layer and serves as a first terminal wherein magnetic flux 70a is directed through an air bearing surface (ABS) 55-55 and into a magnetic medium (not shown). After writing one or more magnetic bits, flux 70b returns to the write shield that is a second terminal 45. The STO structure has a first non-magnetic layer (NM1 ) such as seed layer 15 adjoining the first terminal 10, a second nonmagnetic layer (NM2) that may be capping layer 40 adjoining the second terminal 45, and a third non-magnetic layer (NM3) such as spacer 29 formed between a spin injection layer (SIL) 20 and a field generation layer (FGL) 30 to give a NM1/SIUNM3/FGL/NM2 configuration. The STO has a side 54 formed along the ABS, and the write head comprised of main pole 10, STO, and write shield 45 moves in a z-axis direction over a magnetic medium during a write process. The SAF reference layer 20 functions as a SIL also known in the art as a spin polarization (SP) layer that spin polarizes current passing through the STO stack in a current perpendicular to plane (CPP) direction and thereby applies a spin torque on the SAF free layer 30 which serves as the FGL and is also referred to as an oscillation layer. As a result, when a dc bias is applied across the STO stack by injecting direct current with a critical current density into the first terminal 10 or into the second terminal 45, then spin torque on the FGL induces magnetization in layers 31, 35 in SAF structure 30 to oscillate with a large angle oscillation thereby generating a rf field that assists the writing process to a magnetic bit in the magnetic medium. In an alternative embodiment, the roles of the SAF free layer and SAF reference layer may be reversed with SAF layer 30 serving as a SIL and SAF layer 20 functioning as the FGL. It should be understood that SAF reference layer 20 may be substituted with another SAF reference layer described in alternative embodiments or by any reference layer with PMA. Referring to FIG. 7, a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted wherein the free layer has a dual SAF configuration. In this scheme, all the features of the fourth embodiment are retained. In addition, a third dusting layer DL341 , second coupling layer 38, fourth dusting layer DL4 42, and third ferromagnetic layer FL3 39 are sequentially formed on a top surface of FL2 layer 35. The resulting dual SAF free layer structure 44 has a FL1/DL1/coupling layer 1/DL2/FL2/DL3/coupling layer 2/DL4/FL3 configuration. Note that FL3 layer 39 interfaces with a bottom surface of capping layer 40. The second coupling layer 38 induces RKKY coupling between the FL2 and FL3 layers and may be made of the same material as in the first coupling layer 33. DL3 and DL4 layers are selected from the same materials previously described with respect to the DL1 and DL2 layers and enhance RKKY coupling between the FL2 and FL3 layers. Furthermore, FL3 layer 39 has PMA and is preferably one of a laminated stack, L1o ordered alloy, or RE-TM film previously mentioned with regard to FL1 and FL2 layers 31 , 35. Alternatively, the FL3 layer may be made of CoFeB or CoNiFeB. Moreover, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be CoFeB or CoNiFeB. It is believed that a dual SAF free layer design will further improve thermal stability and He for a SAF structure compared with the advantages achieved in previous embodiments for a single SAF free layer scheme. When a SAF free layer structure is employed as described in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the magnetic interaction between the SAF free layer and SAF reference layer is reduced and thereby minimizes the offset field (Ho) on the free layer after patterning the MTJ stack of layers. The Ku (anisotropy constant) for the free layer will impact the Eb (energy barrier) of the memory cell and it is believed that the insertion of two or more dusting layers will also increase the PMA Ku of the free layer thereby increasing Eb and enhancing the retention time of STT-MRAM designs. The lamination number \"n\" in a SAF free layer 30 (or 37 or 44) is preferably minimized to between 1 and 4 in order to prevent Ku from becoming too high and requiring a substantially higher write current when switching the free layer. The present disclosure also anticipates a top spin valve design as depicted in FIG. 8 wherein SAF free layer 30, non-magnetic spacer 29, reference layer 26, and capping layer 40 are consecutively formed on seed layer 15. The resulting MTJ configuration with a single SAF free layer scheme is represented as seed layer/FL1/DL1/coupling layer/DL2/FL2/non-magnetic spacer/API /coupling layer/AP2/cap layer. Therefore, the same layers are employed as in the bottom spin valve embodiment shown in FIG. 4 except the order of deposition on substrate 10 is modified. In particular, the order of AP1 and AP2 layer deposition is changed such that the AP1 layer 23a (or 23) contacts a top surface of the non-magnetic spacer and is deposited before the AP2 layer 21a (or 21) in reference layer 26. Referring to FIG. 9, another top spin valve embodiment is illustrated and retains all of the features of the previous embodiment shown in FIG. 8 except where the SAF free layer structure is further comprised of an uppermost transition layer 24 such as CoFeB/Co as described in an earlier embodiment. As a result, SAF free layer 37 has a FL1/DL1/ coupling layer/DL2/FL2/transition layer configuration wherein the transition layer forms an interface with the nonmagnetic spacer 29. The present disclosure also encompasses a synthetic ferrimagnetic (SyF) free layer structure. In particular, the SAF free layer in each of the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 2-9 may be modified to a SyF configuration by adjusting the thickness of the coupling layer 33 between FL1 layer 31 and FL2 layer 35. Moreover, in a dual SyF free layer embodiment, the thickness of both coupling layers 33, 38 is changed. Note that antiferromagnet'ic coupling is realized when the thickness of coupling layer 33 (and 38) is preferably 4, 9, or 13 Angstroms. However, when the coupling layer thickness is changed to 6 Angstroms or less than 3 Angstroms, then a SyF free layer structure is established wherein the magnetization of FL1 and FL2 layers are aligned in the same perpendicular to plane direction rather than in opposite directions for FL1 and FL2 in SAF embodiments. Thus, a SyF free layer according to one embodiment of the present disclosure has a FL1/DL1 /coupling layer/DL2/FL2 configuration where all the layers have a composition as described in previous embodiments and wherein the coupling layer thickness is limited to 6 Angstroms or less than 3 Angstroms. In a dual SyF free layer configuration, FL1 , FL2, and FL3 have magnetic moments in the same perpendicular to plane direction in contrast to a dual SAF free layer structure where the FL1 and FL3 magnetization direction is opposite to that of the FL2 magnetic moment. Moreover, the dusting layers enhance the ferrimagnetic coupling between the FL1 and FL2 layers. Although there is no beneficial reduction of Ho when a SyF free layer is employed, the SyF structure is believed to provide an advantage over a single free layer because of a higher magnetic volume and higher thermal stability. Once all of the layers in the MTJ stack are formed in the aforementioned embodiments, an annealing process may be performed that is comprised of a temperature between 200\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C, and preferably between 300\u00b0C and 400\u00b0C, for a period of 1 minute to 10 hours. Thereafter, the spin valve structure may be patterned to form a plurality of STT-MRAM memory cells or STO elements on the substrate 10 by a well known photolithography and etch sequence. In an embodiment where the substrate is a bottom electrode, the bottom electrode may be patterned simultaneously with the overlying spin valve stack to enable a higher density of patterned structures for advanced technology designs. Example 1 To demonstrate the benefits of the present disclosure, a patterned MTJ stack was fabricated on a Si substrate according to a SAF free layer embodiment related to FIG. 2. The MTJ stack has a MgO/CoFeB5/Fe5/Mo9/Fe5/CoFeB5/MgTaOx6 configuration wherein the number following a layer composition is a thickness in Angstroms of that layer. MgO serves as a tunnel barrier layer, FL1 and FL2 layers are made of Co2oFe6oB2o, DL1 and DL2 layers are Fe, the coupling layer is a Mo film, and MgTaOx is the cap layer. The MgO layer was formed by first depositing an 8 Angstrom thick Mg layer followed by a radical oxidation (ROX), and then deposition of a 4 Angstrom thick Mg layer. The MgTaOx cap was formed by depositing a Mg:Ta film with a 2:1 ratio and then performing a ROX process, although a natural oxidation method could be used. In another embodiment, a sputter deposition process involving a MgTaOx target may be employed to form a MgTaOx capping layer. A seed layer and reference layer are omitted for this study. All layers were deposited at RT and the stack was annealed at 300\u00b0C for 10 minutes. As pictured in FIG. 10, synthetic antiferromagnetic coupling between FL1 and FL2 layers is achieved in the remanent state between applied field -300 Oe and 300 Oe using the SAF free layer structure of this experiment. Results were obtained by magneto- optical microscopy. A similar result is anticipated when CoFeB in FL1 and FL2 layers is replaced by a laminated stack, a L 0 ordered alloy, or a RE-TM film as explained earlier. In this example, we rely on MgO and MgTaOx layers to induce PMA in the CoFeB FL1 and FL2 layers, respectively, and the Fe/Mo/Fe stack is used to enhance RKKY coupling. Example 2 Referring to FIG. 11 , a second experiment was performed to demonstrate that synthetic ferrimagnetic coupling is achieved between FL1 and FL2 layers in a SyF embodiment according to the present disclosure. A patterned MTJ stack with a MgO/CoFeB5/Co4/Ru6/Co4/CoFeB5/MgTaOx6 configuration was fabricated on a Si substrate. The MgO tunnel barrier, CoFeB FL1 and FL2 layers, and MgTaOx cap layer are the same as in the first experiment (Example 1 ). However, dusting layers DL1 and DL2 are changed to 4 Angstrom thick Co films, and the coupling layer is Ru with a 6 Angstrom thickness. The MTJ stack was annealed at 300\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Free layer magnetic properties are measured perpendicular to the film plane with magneto-optical microscopy and show synthetic ferrimagnetic coupling through a RKKY effect. Note that the plot is consistent with a magnetic state wherein the magnetizations of FL1 and FL2 layers are aligned in the same direction and are perpendicular to the film plane. The advantages of the SAF embodiments of the present disclosure are improved PMA (He and Hk) for a free layer in a magnetic device, and a lower offset field (Ho) on the free layer for better stability. Alternatively, one or both of the FL1 and FL2 layers may be CoFeB or CoNiFeB to enhance the MR ratio while realizing a slight loss in PMA strength. Furthermore, there is enhanced Ku (thermal stability) in the free layer to enable high temperature processing up to at least 400\u00b0C that makes the multilayer stacks described herein suitable for a variety of applications including advanced STT-MRAM devices. Higher thermal stability also increases the retention time of the memory cell for STT- MRAM designs. While this disclosure has been particularly shown and described with reference to, the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.",

        "Description": "Description SUMMARY A trilayer stack may be positioned on an air bearing surface (ABS). The trilayer stack can be configured with a stripe height along an axis orthogonal to the ABS and with first and second magnetic free layers that each has an angled uniaxial anisotropy with respect to the ABS. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an example data storage device.

FIG. 8 provides a flowchart of a magnetic sensor fabrication routine carried out in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Magnetic sensors with enhanced performance through tuned anisotropy are generally disclosed herein. As industry progresses towards reduced form factor data storage devices, demand for larger data capacity and faster data transfer rates increases, which may correspond with smaller magnetic sensor components, such as magnetic shields and data sensing layers. Reduced magnetic component sizes can degrade performance of a data storage device by increasing magnetic instability while reducing the accuracy of sensed data bits. Thus, construction of reduced form factor magnetic sensors that can maintain precise shielding characteristics and enhanced data transfer rates is in increasing demand in the industry. Accordingly, a magnetic sensor can be constructed with a magnetically responsive trilayer stack having a stripe height and positioned on an air bearing surface (ABS). The trilayer stack may have two or more magnetic free layers that each has an angled uniaxial anisotropy with respect to the ABS. Such angled uniaxial anisotropy may allow for greater sensor accuracy with increased signal amplitude and reduce susceptibility to process and design sensitivity. The angled anisotropic layers may further be tuned for enhanced data read performance with minimal increase in sensor thickness as anisotropy angles are optimized to accommodate various environmental and operational characteristics. By orienting the anisotropy of the layers of the trilayer stack, the magnetic stability of a magnetic sensor can be enhanced, especially in reduced form factor data storage devices. The angled anisotropy can further increase operational characteristics of the trilayer read element by improving readback performance by elevating magnetic yield, which may correspond to larger sensed magnetic field and signal amplitude. Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of an example data storage device 100 in a non-limiting environment in which various embodiments of the present invention can be practiced. The device 100 includes a substantially sealed housing 102 formed from a base deck 104 and top cover 106. An internally disposed spindle motor 108 is configured to rotate a number of magnetic storage media 110. The media 110 are accessed by a corresponding array of data transducers (read/write heads) that are each supported by a head gimbal assembly (HGA) 112. Each HGA 112 can be supported by a head-stack assembly 114 (\u0093actuator\u0094) that includes a flexible suspension 116, which in turn is supported by a rigid actuator arm 118. The actuator 114 may pivot about a cartridge bearing assembly 120 through application of current to a voice coil motor (VCM) 122. In this way, controlled operation of the VCM 122 causes the transducers (numerically denoted at 124) to align with tracks (not shown) defined on the media surfaces to store data thereto or retrieve data therefrom. FIG. 2 generally illustrates cross-section and top views of block representations of various embodiments of a magnetic sensor 130 capable of being used in the data storage device of FIG. 1. The sensor 130 can be constructed, as shown in FIG. 2A, with a magnetic stack 132 positioned on an air bearing surface (ABS) and disposed between the ABS and a rear biasing magnet 134. While unlimited in both structural and operational configurations, the stack 132 may have a pair of magnetically free layers 136 separated by a non-magnetic spacer 138, which can be characterized as a trilayer read element due to the three operational layers and the lack of any pinning magnetic layers included in the stack 132 itself. The use of a trilayer read element configuration can provide reduced shield-to-shield spacing 140, especially in high linear density data storage devices, as the rear biasing magnet 134 provides set magnetization to the free layers 136 to allow data bits to be sensed without adding to the stack's size. Placement of the rear biasing magnet 134 further allows for tuning of the size and position to optimize performance of the stack 132. For example, the biasing magnet 134 can be formed a biasing distance 142 from the stack 132 and with a biasing thickness 144 that provides a decoupling distance 146, that may be filled with insulating material, from any magnetic shields included in the magnetic sensor 130. Inclusion of magnetic shields (not shown) to the magnetic sensor 130 can be separated from the magnetic stack 132 with one or more decoupling layers 148, such as cap and seed layers, that may be tuned with any number of layers and materials that isolate magnetization transfer between the stack 132 and any shields. The sensor 130 may be further tuned for optimized performance by adjusting the dimensions and magnetizations of the stack 132 and biasing magnet 134, as displayed in top view of FIG. 2B. While a biasing magnet thickness 144 that is focused about the spacer layer 138 may provide enhanced magnetic influence on the stack 132, the respective stack and biasing magnet widths 150 and 152, as measured parallel to the ABS along the Z axis, can be tuned to be similar or dissimilar to correspond to respective stack and biasing magnet stripe heights 154 and 156. The width and stripe heights of the stack 132 and biasing magnet 134 can be minutely tuned to provide a MPM magnetization of predetermined strength and angular orientation that influences the respective magnetic free layers 136 of the stack 132 to predetermined set magnetizations, MFL1 and MFL2. As such, the various dimensions, thicknesses, and magnetic orientations of the stack 132 and biasing magnet 134 can allow for precise tuning to accommodate any number of predetermined operational and environmental conditions while maintaining a reduced form factor. However, process and design variability may increase magnetic sensitivity that endangers accurate data sensing. FIG. 3 provides example operational characteristics of an example magnetic sensor with respect to the magnetic stack's stripe height. Solid line 160 plots data signal amplitude that increases as stripe height increases until a pinnacle point, then decreases rapidly. Similar, but unique behavior is displayed by segmented line 162 that corresponds to magnetic stack asymmetry, which increases to an intermediate stripe height and subsequently decreases. It can be appreciated that the dimensions of a sensor stack, particularly a trilayer read element stack, can be tuned to a wide variety of operational behaviors with merely the adjustment of the stack stripe height, such as height 154 of FIG. 2B. While a relatively large stripe height can be utilized to provide optimized data sensing in certain situations, line 162 illustrates how asymmetry can be a potential susceptibility of such a magnetic sensor. Therefore, various embodiments herein tune magnetic sensors with a reduced stripe height stack that decreases process complexity and magnetic sensitivity to process parameters while enhancing data readback signal amplitude. In some embodiments, a relatively short stack stripe height is configured with varying uniaxial anisotropies that are tuned for orientation and strength to provide enhanced data sensing performance. Such varying uniaxial anisotropies may be constructed in various unlimited manners, such as oblique deposition, that allows for anisotropic angles to be precisely set and maintained. FIGS. 4A-4C respectively graph example hysteresis loops for magnetically free layers with different magnetization anisotropies formed with oblique deposition of varying angles. FIG. 4A displays loop 170 corresponding to a magnetically free layer formed, at least partially, by oblique deposition at 60\u00b0, which can result in an anisotropic strength of approximately 100 Oe. In comparison, loop 172 of FIG. 4B, deposited with a 70\u00b0 angle, has approximately a 300 Oe anisotropic strength along with an increased transition region between free layer magnetic saturations. With a deposition angle of 75\u00b0, as shown by loop 174 in FIG. 4C, anisotropic strength and transition region characteristics increase to approximately 1000 Oe and a 2000 Oe transition between magnetic saturations. The construction of a relatively short magnetic stack stripe height, such as a height that is less than twice the stack width (150 of FIG. 2B), can exhibit optimized performance when anisotropic strength is between roughly 600-1000 Oe, which may be procured by depositing at least one free layer at angles in the proximity of 75\u00b0. While not limiting, such deposition angle can be formed by controlled-incidence sputtering (CIS) where flux passes through a shutter window onto a rotating sample while both shutter and sample sweeps laterally in parallel planes. CIS can be used to precisely deposit particles with a mean angle of incidence that can form predetermined uniaxial anisotropies. With the variety of uniaxial anisotropy strengths that may be provided by forming at least one free layer with oblique deposition, further tuning and optimization can be achieved by canting the angle of one or more uniaxial anisotropies with respect to the ABS. FIGS. 5A-5C generally illustrate top views of various example magnetic stacks tuned with a variety of uniaxial anisotropies in accordance with various embodiments. FIG. 5A provides magnetic stack 180 with magnetization anisotropies, HK FL1 and HK FL2, that are each substantially parallel to the ABS and default magnetizations, MFL1 and MFL2, set at predetermined angles by a biasing magnet (not shown). The angle of the uniaxial anisotropies for the free layers of stack 180 can be tuned in relation to a predetermined stripe height 182, such as 39 nm, to optimize the process and design sensitivity of the stack 180 while enhancing data signal amplitude. The uniaxial anisotropies and stack stripe height 182 can be further tuned for magnitude and cant angle to precisely control performance of the stack 180 while maintaining a reduced form factor. FIG. 5B illustrates magnetic stack 184 that has magnetizations similar to that of FIG. 5A, but cants each uniaxial anisotropy with respective angles, \u03b81 and \u03b82, in relation to the ABS. The angle orientations of the uniaxial anisotropies in stack 184 are not required or limited and can be modified, at will, to optimize performance. For example, the anisotropy angles can be complimentary angles or set to predetermined similar angles, such as 10\u00b0. FIG. 5C shows another example magnetic stack 186 that has uniaxial anisotropies set at unique angles, such as 10\u00b0 for \u03b83 and 15\u00b0 for \u03b84. The ability to adjust and tune the performance of the magnetic stack 186 by choosing the angles of the uniaxial anisotropies may correspond to reduced operational asymmetry between the magnetically free layers of the stack 186. The selection of uniaxial anisotropy angles can further be selected and tuned in relation to the thickness of the rear biasing magnet, such as magnet 134 of FIG. 2A. That is, the angle and strength of the uniaxial anisotropies may be selected to correspond to a reduced biasing magnet thickness that can allow the anisotropy to fully enhance readback signal amplitude and design sensitivity. FIGS. 6A and 6B plot magnetization asymmetry and signal amplitude for various tuned configurations of a magnetic stack. One such configuration is represented by segmented line 190, which maps a magnetic free layer with uniaxial anisotropy with a 300 Oe strength and no cant with respect to the ABS. Such an anisotropic configuration may result in elevated magnetization asymmetry and signal amplitude for various stripe heights while providing reduced signal amplitude in other stripe heights. A more conservative magnetically free layer configuration, displayed by segmented line 192, can have a 600 Oe, no cant, and an anisotropic strength corresponding to a biasing magnet (PM) with a 9 nm thickness, like thickness 144 of FIG. 2A. As shown, the magnetization asymmetry and signal amplitude are reduced compared to the reduced anisotropic strength of line 192. Solid line 194 illustrates how a 1000 Oe anisotropic strength and 15\u00b0 cant can enhance performance for both magnetization asymmetry and signal amplitude for a majority of stripe heights. The reduced asymmetry and signal amplitude volatility can provide enhanced data sensing while being more resilient to design and process variability. The variety of operational characteristics can allow for the tuning and optimization of a magnetic stack with free layers having different uniaxial anisotropic characteristics, such as anisotropic strength and cant angle. FIGS. 7A-7D generally display isometric views of an example manufacture for various structural configurations capable of being used in various magnetic sensors to tune and optimize data sensing performance. FIG. 7A shows magnetic sensor 200 with a decoupling seed layer 202 formed with a first thickness 204 and a first stripe height 206 by an oblique deposition process that deposits the seed layer material, such as Ru and Ta, at a first angle \u03b81 with respect to the Z axis. The decoupling seed layer 202 can be subsequently used as a substrate to directly couple a first magnetically free layer 208 onto, as displayed in FIG. 7B. The free layer 208 can have a second thickness 210 and an unlimited stripe height that may or may not match the stripe height 206 when formed by oblique deposition from a second angle \u03b82 with respect to the Z axis. FIG. 7C shows a non-magnetic spacer layer 212 can then be formed atop the first magnetically free layer 208 with a predetermined thickness 214, material, such as MgO, and stripe height. It should be noted that the non-magnetic nature of the spacer layer 212 may correspond to any deposition technique, such as physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and sputtering. FIG. 7D displays how a second magnetically free layer 216 can be formed onto the spacer layer 212 with oblique deposition from a third angle \u03b83 that results in a predetermined uniaxial anisotropy, layer thickness 218, and unlimited stripe height distance. While additional layers, such as a decoupling cap layer, may be further included into the magnetic sensor 200, FIGS. 7A-7D illustrate the variety of materials, deposition techniques, stripe heights, and thicknesses that can be individually or collectively tuned to provide predetermined data sensing performance. It should be noted that the various magnetic sensor configurations of FIGS. 7A-7D are merely examples and are in no way limiting or restricting. In fact, the configurations of varying magnetically free layers 208 and 216 may be uniquely tuned to any number of uniaxial anisotropies that can correspond, as discussed above, to reduced stripe heights, thin rear biasing magnets, and canted anisotropies, which can accommodate operational environments, such as reduced form factor and increased data transfer rate data storage devices. FIG. 8 provides an example flowchart of a sensor fabrication routine 250 conducted in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Initially, the routine 250 determines in decision 252 if an anisotropic layer is to be the bottom layer of the magnetic sensor. While not required or limited, a magnetic shield or decoupling layer, such as seed layer 202 of FIG. 7A, can be formed with or without magnetization anisotropy depending on the predetermined operation of the magnetic sensor. If an anisotropic layer is to be formed, decision 252 advances to decision 254 where the oblique deposition angle is evaluated. As discussed in relation to FIGS. 4A-4C, an oblique deposition angle may directly correspond to the uniaxial anisotropy of the resultant layer. However, it is to be understood that oblique deposition is not the only manner in which uniaxial anisotropy can be constructed. Establishment of the deposition angle, decision 256 then determines the stripe height of the layer, which can affect the strength and operational behavior of the corresponding uniaxial anisotropy, as illustrated in FIGS. 6 a and 6B. With the uniaxial magnetization anisotropy either determined in decisions 254 and 256, or if no anisotropy is chosen in decision 252, block 258 next deposits the layer to conform to the predetermined specifications. The uniaxial anisotropy can further undergo tuning and modification by varying the angle of the anisotropy with respect to an air bearing surface (ABS), which is evaluated in decision 260. While not required or limited, in some embodiments, the anisotropy is canted by annealing the anisotropic layer in block 262. Such annealing can increase the anisotropic strength of the layer while rotating the axis of the anisotropy depending on the direction of annealing with respect to the anisotropy. That is, annealing a layer parallel or orthogonal to the easy axis parallel to the anisotropy may produce minimal rotation while annealing roughly 45 degrees with respect to the easy axis can rotate the anisotropy, which can be repeated an unlimited number of times to provide anisotropy canted at an angle determined in decision 260. The formation of the layer either from block 258 or block 262 then proceeds to evaluate in decision 264 if another layer is to be formed in the magnetic sensor. If so, the routine 250 returns to decision 252 where another layer is formed that may or may not have uniaxial anisotropy. In the event decision 264 determines no other layers are to be included in the magnetic stack, decision 266 evaluates if a biasing magnet is to be installed into the sensor, to which decision 268 then determines the thickness of the biasing magnet to be formed by block 270. It can be appreciated that a wide variety of magnetic sensors can be constructed from the routine 250 that exhibit various structural and operational characteristics, such as shortened stripe heights and varying uniaxial anisotropies between magnetically free layers. The routine 250, however, is not limited only to the blocks and decisions provided in FIG. 8 as any number of blocks and determinations can be added, omitted, and modified to accommodate the fabrication of a precisely tuned magnetic sensor that utilizes uniaxial anisotropy to provide enhanced magnetic sensing with reduced sensitivity to design and process variability. The various configurations and material characteristics of the magnetic sensor described in the present disclosure may allow for enhanced data reading performance while maintaining a reduced form factor due to the use of varying uniaxial anisotropies in each magnetically free layer. Each free layer can be tuned and optimized in relation to each other to provide uniaxial anisotropies of different strengths and orientations that may correspond to increased magnetic stability as sensitivity to design and process variability is reduced. Moreover, data signal amplitude may be increased as the tuned uniaxial magnetization anisotropies can operate in reduced stripe height stacks that exhibit low magnetization asymmetry. In addition, while the embodiments have been directed to magnetic sensing, it will be appreciated that the claimed invention can readily be utilized in any number of other applications, including data storage device applications. It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and configurations of various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments of the invention, this detailed description is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangements of parts within the principles of the present invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the particular elements may vary depending on the particular application without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.",

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) United States Patent Ofifice 3,160,575 Patented Dec. 8, 1964 Recently, thin metallic ferromagnetic layers of several hundred to several thousand Angstrom units, A., socalled thin films, have gained considerable scientific interest and technical significance, particularly for use as highspeed-storage elements in the communications field. They consist of ferromagnetic metals or metal alloys, preferably composed so as to have the crystal anisotropy constant K and the magnetostriction constant approximately zero. The thin metallic layers are applied by vaporizing the respective metals or metal alloys from one or several vaporizing sources (spirals, shuttles or crucibles of high-temperature resistant material, for instance W, Ta, Al O etc.) in a high vacuum torr) onto suitable carrier substances (fine-polished glass, polished ceramic sheets, etc.), which, in some cases may be heated before they are coated. To produce a uniaxial anisotropy, a homogeneous static magnetic field of a definite magnitude is allowed to react in the direction of the supporting surface, or, the uniaxial anisotropy which is an important feature of the magnetic field may be produced in a magnetic field by a separate annealing process. Although the thin layers produced are polycrystalline, they behave like a unitary magnetic domain because of their uniaxial anisotropy. The direction of the spontaneous magnetization is parallel to the direction of the induced uniaxial anisotropy. The magnetic reversal of such a layer takes place starting at a definite magnitude of an outside magnetic field which is effective parallel to the layer through coherent rotation of the magnetization vectors to the second stable position of the magnetization direction, which is counter to the original magnetization direction by 180\". The thus obtained times for magnetic reversals are of the magnitude of some 10* sec. and are smaller by two to three orders of magnitude than in the ordinarily used ferrite ring cores with rectangular hysteresis loops. This invention describes a method of producing thin ferromagnetic layers consisting of soft magnetic ferrites which possess a uniaxial anisotropy, which is produced either during the making of the layer under the influence of a suitable magnetic'field or by subsequent annealing in a magnetic field. For this purpose the invention provides the application of the methods employed in the production of thin metallic layers by high vacuum evaporation, cathodic evaporation or the electrolytic precipitation upon such ferrites which, as to their composition, exhibit uniaxial anisotropy. After annealing in a magnetic field, certain ferrites of the sof category show the phenomenon c-f uniaxial anisotropy, with a crystal-anisotropy-constant K compensated to approximately zero by the addition of a small quantity of Co-ferrite or cobalt ferrite-forming components, and having a magnetostriction constant which, by suitably apportioned addition of Fe O likewise is brought to values near zero. Without annealing in the magnetic field these ferrites show constricted hysteresis loops, also called Perminvar loops, while under heat treatment in the longitudinal, or transverse magnetic field, they display rectangular, or Isop'erm hysteresis loops, respectively. The directional designations, longitudinal or transverse, refer to the relative position of the annealing and the measuring field to each other. According to the invention all those soft magnetic ferrites are suitable for producing thin layers of uniaxial anisotropy which have an Fe O content of more than 50 mol percent and which have a Co-oxide content of 0.1-5 percent by weight, preferably 0.3-1 percent by weight. The following examples describe the process of the invention. I EXAMPLES 1 PRODUCTION OF A Ni-FERRITE LAYER OF UNIAXIAL ANISOTROPY A. By Oxidation 0] Metallic Layers ((2 The raw material consists of a Ni-FeCo alloy of the following range of composition: This is deposited by evaporation from a suitable evaporating crucible, for instance, A1 0 or MgO, in a high vacuum p 10 torr) upon a suitable substrate, which may be heated, for instance, fire-polished glass, polished A1 0 or the like, to a layer thickness of several hundred or several thousand A. units. The layer thus produced is polycrystalline and is further treated, in accordance with the invention, as follows: It is carefully oxidized at a temperature range between 600 and 1000 C. bysuitable dosage of the oxygen content of a nitrogen-oxygen mixture until the Rontgenor electron diffraction clearly discloses the spinel lattice of the ferrites. At this stage of the oxidation the oxygen feed is cut off, and during the cooling of the ferrite layer from some ten degrees above the Curie temperature down to room temperature, a static magnetic field effective in the layer plane for the production of the desired uniaxial anisotropy is applied. The primary metal layer may also be produced, without restricting the scope of the invention, by high vacuum evaporation of the alloy components from separately located evaporation sources. This modification of the process has the advantage that in case of diiferent evaporation temperatures of the individual alloy components, the heat may be individually adapted and the concentration adjusted, for example, by rotating sector shutters in front of the evaporation sources. (a The primary metal layer may further be produced by cathodic sputtering and deposition in vacuum by means of oxidation-inhibiting sputtering gases, for instance, rare gases, N or also H at a pressure of 10 to 10* torr, wherein the cathode employed is a metal alloy of the above-indicated composition range, or separate cathode blocks, consisting of the individual alloy components may be employed. The latter will always be advantageous when the sputtering conditions for the individual alloy components differ Widely and require differentiated sputtering potentials. Further, in this manner the concentration of the metal layer applied through the rotating sector shutters may be more readily controlled. (:1 In another version, the primary metal layer can be produced by the electrolytic methods ordinarily employed for electroplating, such as described, for instance, by I. W. Wolf and V. P. McConnell, Proc. Am. Electroplaters Soc. 1-4, 1956, and I. W. Wolf, H. W. Katz, A. E. Brain, Proc. 1959, Electronic Component Conf., pages 15-20. B.

No. 13/561,201 filed on Jul. 30, 2012 that is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/068,398, filed on May 10, 2011 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,541,855, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, and assigned to a common assignee. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a magnetic device that employs a thin film made of a Ni/Co laminate or the like with a magnetization direction which is perpendicular to the plane of the film (perpendicular magnetic anisotropy or PMA) wherein PMA is enhanced by an improved seed layer that induces a strong (111) crystal structure in the Ni/Co multilayer stack. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), based on the integration of silicon CMOS with magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) technology, is a major emerging technology that is highly competitive with existing semiconductor memories such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash. Similarly, spin-transfer (spin torque or STT) magnetization switching described by C. Slonczewski in \u0093Current driven excitation of magnetic multilayers\u0094, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. V 159, L1-L7 (1996), has stimulated considerable interest due to its potential application for spintronic devices such as spin-torque MRAM on a gigabit scale. Both MRAM and STT-MRAM may have a MTJ element based on a tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect wherein a stack of layers has a configuration in which two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer. The MTJ element is typically formed between a bottom electrode such as a first conductive line and a top electrode which is a second conductive line at locations where the top electrode crosses over the bottom electrode. A MTJ stack of layers may have a bottom spin valve configuration in which a seed layer, an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer, a ferromagnetic \u0093pinned\u0094 layer, a thin tunnel barrier layer, a ferromagnetic \u0093free\u0094 layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on a bottom electrode. The pinned or reference layer has a magnetic moment that is fixed in the \u0093y\u0094 direction, for example, by exchange coupling with the adjacent anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) layer that is also magnetized in the \u0093y\u0094 direction. The free layer has a magnetic moment that is either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic moment in the pinned layer. The tunnel barrier layer is thin enough that a current through it can be established by quantum mechanical tunneling of conduction electrons. The magnetic moment of the free layer may change in response to external magnetic fields and it is the relative orientation of the magnetic moments between the free and pinned layers that determines the tunneling current and therefore the resistance of the tunneling junction. When a sense current is passed from the top electrode to the bottom electrode in a direction perpendicular to the MTJ layers, a lower resistance is detected when the magnetization directions of the free and pinned layers are in a parallel state (\u00930\u0094 memory state) and a higher resistance is noted when they are in an anti-parallel state or \u00931\u0094 memory state. As the size of MRAM cells decreases, the use of external magnetic fields generated by current carrying lines to switch the magnetic moment direction becomes problematic. One of the keys to manufacturability of ultra-high density MRAMs is to provide a robust magnetic switching margin by eliminating the half-select disturb issue. For this reason, the spin torque MRAM was developed. Compared with conventional MRAM, spin-torque MRAM has an advantage in avoiding the half select problem and writing disturbance between adjacent cells. The spin-transfer effect arises from the spin dependent electron transport properties of ferromagnetic-spacer-ferromagnetic multilayers. When a spin-polarized current transverses a magnetic multilayer in a CPP configuration, the spin angular moment of electrons incident on a ferromagnetic layer interacts with magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic layer near the interface between the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic spacer. Through this interaction, the electrons transfer a portion of their angular momentum to the ferromagnetic layer. As a result, spin-polarized current can switch the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic layer if the current density is sufficiently high, and if the dimensions of the multilayer are small. The difference between a spin-torque MRAM and a conventional MRAM is only in the write operation mechanism. The read mechanism is the same. For MRAM and spin-torque MRAM applications, it is often important to take advantage of PMA films with a large and tunable coercivity field (Hc) and anisotropy field (Hk). For example, PMA films may be used as a pinned layer, free layer, or dipole (offset compensation) layer in a MTJ element or in PMA media used in magnetic sensors, magnetic data storage, and in other spintronic devices. Furthermore, a critical requirement is that Hc, Hk, and other properties such as the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio do not deteriorate during processing at elevated temperatures up to the 300\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. range. In some applications, it is also necessary to limit the overall thickness of the PMA layer and underlayers, and use only materials that are compatible with device design and processing requirements. Materials with PMA are of particular importance for magnetic and magnetic-optic recording applications. Spintronic devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have an advantage over MRAM devices based on in-plane anisotropy in that they can satisfy the thermal stability requirement and have a low switching current density but also have no limit of cell aspect ratio. As a result, spin valve structures based on PMA are capable of scaling for higher packing density which is one of the key challenges for future MRAM applications and other spintronic devices. When the size of a memory cell is reduced, much larger magnetic anisotropy is required because the thermal stability factor is proportional to the volume of the memory cell. Generally, PMA materials have magnetic anisotropy larger than that of conventional in-plane soft magnetic materials such as NiFe or CoFeB. Thus, magnetic devices with PMA are advantageous for achieving a low switching current and high thermal stability. Several PMA material systems have been proposed and utilized in the prior art such as multilayers of Pt/Fe, Pd/Co, and Ni/Co, and ordered (e.g., L10 structures) as well as unordered alloys but there is still a need for improvement in Hc, Hk, temperature stability, and material compatibility. There is a report by M. Nakayama et al. in \u0093Spin transfer switching in TbCoFe/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/TbCoFe magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\u0094, J. Appl. Phys. 103, 07A710 (2008) related to spin transfer switching in a MTJ employing a TbCoFe PMA structure. However, in a MTJ with a TbCoFe or FePt PMA layer, strenuous annealing conditions are usually required to achieve an acceptably high PMA value. Unfortunately, high temperatures are not so practical for device integration. Although (Co/Pt)X laminates are capable of generating high PMA, Co/Pt and similar multilayers including Co/Pd and Co/Ir and alloys thereof such as CoCrPt are not always desirable as a PMA layer in a MTJ element because Pt, Pd, Ir, and Cr are severe spin depolarizing materials and will seriously quench the amplitude of spintronic devices. Among the PMA material systems studied, a Ni/Co multilayer is one of the more promising candidates because of its large potential Hc and Hk, good stability at high anneal temperatures, and potential compatibility with other materials used in magnetic devices. However, Ni/Co multilayers typically require a thick seed layer to induce high PMA. A 500 Angstrom Ti or 500 Angstrom Cu seed layer with heating to 150\u00b0 C. is used by P. Bloemen et al. in \u0093Magnetic anisotropies in Co/Ni (111) multilayers\u0094, J. Appl. Phys. 72, 4840 (1992). W. Chen et al. in \u0093Spin-torque driven ferromagnetic resonance of Co/Ni synthetic layers in spin valves\u0094, Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 012507 (2008) describe a 1000 Angstrom Cu/200 Angstrom Pt/100 Angstrom Cu composite seed layer. The aforementioned seed layers are not practical with Ni/Co multilayer PMA configurations in spintronic devices. Typically, there is a space restriction in a direction perpendicular to the planes of the spin valve layers in advanced devices in order to optimize performance. Seed layers thicker than about 100 Angstroms will require thinning a different layer in the spin valve structure to maintain a certain minimum thickness for the MTJ element which can easily lead to performance degradation. A [(Co/Ni)20] laminated structure with a thin Ta/Ru/Cu seed layer is disclosed as a hard bias layer in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2010/0330395 and as a reference layer in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0257151. However, even higher Hc is desirable to be competitive with Hc values obtained with Pt/Co and Pd/Co laminates. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,843,669, a fcc (111) crystal orientation is described as desirable for a pinned layer or free layer but a Ni/Co laminate with (111) orientation is not disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 7,190,613 describes a fixed layer having a high coercive force and made of ordered alloys such as FePt, CoPt, and FePd, or disordered alloys including Co/Cr, Co/Pt, Co/Cr/Pt and the like. For ordered alloys with a fct(001) orientation, an underlayer such as MgO, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Al or Cr with a similar crystal structure is preferred. An improved seed layer is still needed that is thin enough to be compatible with spintronic devices, can induce high PMA in overlying Co/Ni multilayer structures, and is compatible with the design and processing requirements of magnetic devices. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One objective of the present invention is to provide a seed layer/PMA layer configuration for a magnetic device that has higher Hk and Hc than previously realized and with thermal stability up to 400\u00b0 C. process temperatures. A second objective of the present invention is to provide a material set for a high PMA structure according to the first objective that is compatible with other layers in the magnetic device and has a seed layer thickness of about 100 Angstroms or less. According to one embodiment, these objectives are achieved with a magnetic element that is a MTJ having a bottom spin valve configuration in which a seed layer, PMA reference layer, tunnel barrier, free layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The seed layer (underlayer) is preferably NiCr, NiFeCr, Hf, or a composite with a Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf configuration that induces a strong (111) texture in the overlying Co/Ni multilayer stack within the reference layer. In an alternative embodiment, Ni in the Co/Ni multilayer is replaced by X to give a Co/X multilayer stack within the reference layer where X is one of V, Rh, Ir, Os, Ru, Au, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ti, Re, Si, and Mg. Preferably, the reference layer has a [(Co/Ni)n/CoFeB] or [Co/X)n/CoFeB] configuration where n is from 2 to 30 and the CoFeB (or CoFe) layer serves as a transitional layer between the (111) crystalline structure of the Co/Ni or Co/X multilayer stack and the (100) texture of a MgO tunnel barrier. The transitional layer preferably has PMA and a magnetization aligned in the same direction as the PMA layer. The free layer may be comprised of CoFeB, CoFe, or a combination thereof. Thus, a high MR ratio is achieved together with high PMA in the reference layer to enable greater thermal stability in the magnetic element. In a second embodiment, the MTJ has a top spin valve structure wherein a seed layer, PMA free layer, tunnel barrier, reference layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The PMA free layer may be a composite with a Co/Ni or Co/X laminate formed on the seed layer and an upper magnetic layer contacting the tunnel barrier. Again, the magnetic layer may be CoFeB and serve as a transitional layer between a (100) MgO tunnel barrier and a Co/Ni multilayer with a (111) texture. Both of the first and second embodiments may further comprise a Ta insertion layer between the Co/Ni or Co/X multilayer and the transitional layer to prevent premature crystallization of the transitional layer before the tunnel barrier is fabricated. In a third embodiment, a dipole layer with an underlayer/PMA layer configuration as defined in the first embodiment is used to provide an offset field to an adjacent free layer. The MTJ has a stack represented by seed layer/reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer/spacer/dipole layer/capping layer. The spacer may be a non-magnetic Ta layer to getter oxygen from the free layer. Once all the layers in the MTJ stack are laid down, a high temperature annealing of about 350\u00b0 C. may be employed to increase the PMA within the Co/Ni laminated portion of the reference layer, free layer, or dipole layer. Alternatively, the (Co/Ni)n multilayer in the previous embodiments may be replaced by a CoFe/Ni, Co/NiFe, Co/NiCo, CoFe/NiFe, or a CoFe/NiCo laminated structure, by pure Co, or may be one of Co/Pt, Co/Pd, Fe/Pt, Fe/Pd, or FeN. In yet another embodiment, the (Co/X) stack described previously may be replaced by a disordered alloy that is one of CoV, CoRh, CoIr, CoOs, CoRu, CoAu, CoCr, CoMo, CoCu, CoTi, CoRe, CoMg, or CoSi to give a (CoX)n laminated PMA layer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a composite structure with a seed layer/PMA layer configuration in a magnetic element wherein the seed layer induces a strong (111) crystalline structure in an overlying (Ni/Co)n, (Co/X)n or (CoX)n multilayer where X is one of V, Rh, Ir, Os, Ru, Au, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ti, Re, Mg, or Si thereby generating high PMA in the laminated stack. Note that \u0093seed layer\u0094 may be used interchangeably with the term \u0093underlayer\u0094 in the exemplary embodiments, and (Ni/Co)n and (Co/Ni)n, for example, are used interchangeably when referring to a laminated stack. Although only bottom and top spin valve structures are depicted in the drawings, the present invention also encompasses dual spin valves having an enhanced PMA layer that is incorporated in one or more of a reference layer, free layer, dipole layer, or pinned layer in MRAM, spin-torque-MRAM, domain wall motion devices, and in other spintronic devices. Furthermore, the PMA structure may be used as a medium in magnetic sensors or in magnetic data storage applications. A key feature of the present invention is a (Co/Ni)n or (Co/X)n multilayer structure having PMA where the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the aforementioned laminate arises from spin-orbit interactions of the 3d and 4s electrons of Co and Ni (or Co and X) atoms. Such interaction causes the existence of an orbital moment which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal axes which are in (111) alignment, and also leads to an alignment of the spin moment with the orbital moment. PMA character is enhanced by the presence of an appropriate seed layer (underlayer) also having a (111) texture. Ideally, the seed layer has a composition which is compatible with other materials in a magnetic element that contains the (Co/Ni)n or (Co/X)n laminate, is compatible with processing temperatures up to about 400\u00b0 C., and is thin enough so as not to adversely affect the performance of the magnetic element. Referring to FIG. 1, a seed layer/PMA multilayer configuration is shown as part of a MTJ 20 with a bottom spin valve structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Each of the layers in the MTJ are formed in an (x, y) plane and each have a thickness in a z-axis direction. A substrate 21 is provided that may be a bottom electrode layer, for example, made of Ta or other conductive layers. Substrate 21 may be formed on a substructure (not shown) that includes dielectric and conductive layers as well as transistors and other devices. A key feature is the seed layer 22 formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 22 has a thickness from 10 to 300 Angstroms, and preferably 10 to 100 Angstroms. According to one embodiment, the seed layer is NiCr, NiFeCr, or Hf. For a NiCr or NiFeCr seed layer, Cr content is between 35 and 45 atomic % Cr, and preferably is 40 atomic % Cr. Alternatively, seed layer 22 may be a composite with a Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf composition wherein the NiCr or NiFeCr layer has a greater thickness than the Hf layer. As a result of the preferred seed layer composition, a (111) texture is induced and fully established in a (Co/Ni)n multilayer or the like grown on a top surface of the seed layer. Top surface in this context is a surface facing away from substrate 21. Above the seed layer 22 is a composite reference layer 30 that according to one embodiment has a (Co/Ni)n/CoFeB, a (Co/X)n/CoFeB, or (CoX)n/CoFeB configuration wherein a lower PMA layer 23 has a (Co/Ni)n, (Co/X)n, or (CoX)n composition in which n is from 2 to 30, and preferably between 4 and 10, and CoX is a disordered alloy. PMA layer 23 contacts the seed layer while a magnetic layer 24 made of CoFeB, CoFe, or a combination thereof is formed as an interface between the PMA layer and the tunnel barrier 25. Each of the plurality of Co layers in the PMA layer has a thickness from 1.5 to 4 Angstroms, and each of the plurality of Ni, X, or CoX layers has a thickness from 4 to 10 Angstroms. In yet another embodiment, PMA layer 23 may be pure Co. In another embodiment, the lower PMA layer 23 may be comprised of two metals, a metal and an alloy, or two alloys having an (A1/A2)n configuration where A1 is a first metal or alloy selected from one or more of Co Ni, and Fe that may be doped with B up to 50 atomic %, A2 is a second metal or alloy selected from one or more of Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, and Pd, n is the number of laminates in the (A1/A2)n stack, and A1 is unequal to A2. It should be understood that the laminated (A1/A2)n stack has intrinsic PMA and the seed layer 22 is employed to enhance the PMA property. Thus, the PMA layer 23 may be comprised of (CoFe/Ni)n, Co/NiFe)n, (Co/NiCo)n, (CoFe/NiFe)n, or (CoFe/NiCo)n laminates, for example. Alternatively, the PMA layer may have a (Co/Pt)n, Co/Pd)n, (Fe/Pt)n, (Fe/Pd)n, or (FeN)n composition, or a combination of the aforementioned laminates. In another embodiment, A2 is a second metal or alloy selected from one or more of X, FeX, and CoX. In this case, the PMA layer 23 may be comprised of (CoFe/X)n, Co/FeX)n, (Co/CoX)n, (CoFe/FeX)n, or (CoFe/CoX)n laminates. In yet another embodiment, the lower PMA layer 23 may be comprised of two individual magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer (C) providing anti-ferromagnetic (RKKY) coupling between the two magnetic layers as in an A1/C/A2 configuration. In this embodiment, the non-magnetic spacer is preferably Ru with a thickness of 3 to 20 angstroms. The present invention also encompasses an embodiment wherein the lower PMA layer 23 may be an alloy with a L10 structure of the form MT wherein M is Rh, Pd, Pt, Ir, or an alloy thereof, and T is Fe, Co, Ni or alloy thereof. Furthermore, the MT alloy may be doped with B up to 40 atomic %. Preferably, the magnetic layer 24 has a thickness from about 6 to 14 Angstroms which is sufficiently thin to enable interfacial perpendicular anisotropy to dominate the in-plane shape anisotropy field and thereby generate PMA character therein. According to one embodiment, PMA within magnetic layer 24 is achieved as a result of the interface between a thin CoFeB (or CoFe) layer and a metal oxide layer in tunnel barrier 25 that leads to a significant amount of interfacial perpendicular anisotropy, and the magnetic moments of layers 23, 24 are aligned in the same direction along the z-axis. The magnetic layer serves as a transitional layer between the (111) texture in PMA layer 23 and a (100) texture in tunnel barrier 25 and may also enhance the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio. As the magnetic layer thickness becomes closer to 6 Angstroms, PMA character is maximized, and as layer 24 thickness approaches 14 Angstroms, MR ratio is increased. Therefore, the thickness of the magnetic layer may be adjusted between 6 and 14 Angstroms to tune both PMA magnitude and MR ratio. There is a tunnel barrier layer 25 preferably made of MgO formed on the composite reference layer 30. However, other tunnel barrier materials such as AlOx, TiOx, and ZnOx may be employed. A MgO tunnel barrier layer may be fabricated by depositing a first Mg layer on the magnetic layer 24, then performing a natural oxidation (NOX) process, and finally depositing a second Mg layer on the oxidized first Mg layer. During a subsequent annealing process, the second Mg layer is oxidized to afford a substantially uniform MgO layer. If a low RA (resistance\u00d7area) value is desired, the thickness and/or oxidation state of the tunnel barrier 25 may be reduced as appreciated by those skilled in the art. A free layer 26 is formed on the tunnel barrier layer 25 and may be a composite and comprised of the same composition as in magnetic layer 24. Preferably, CoFeB, CoFe, or other materials which produce a combination of high MR ratio, good switching property, and low magnetostriction are selected as the free layer. The uppermost layer in the spin valve stack is a capping layer 27. In one aspect, the capping layer is a composite with a lower layer 27 a made of Ta and an upper layer 27 b that is Ru which is used to provide oxidation resistance and excellent electrical contact to an overlying top electrode (not shown). A substantial reduction in critical current density (Jc) occurs in STT-MRAM applications when a thin Ru layer is employed as a capping layer due to the strong spin scattering effect of Ru. The Ta layer may be included to offer etch resistance in subsequent processing steps. Optionally, other capping layer configurations may be employed. For example, the capping layer 27 may be a single layer of Ta or Ru, a composite with a Ru/Ta/Ru configuration, or a composite with a lower oxide or nitride layer and an upper Ru layer such as MgO/Ru or AlOx/Ru. An oxide as the lower layer in the capping layer may be advantageously used to promote PMA in a thin free layer 26. Referring to FIG. 2, the composite reference layer 30 of the first embodiment is modified to include a Ta insertion layer 35 about 0.5 to 3 Angstroms thick, and preferably 1.5 Angstroms thick, sandwiched between the PMA layer and an amorphous CoFeB magnetic layer 24 to prevent crystallization of the CoFeB layer before a MgO tunnel barrier 25 is formed thereon. As a result, crystallization of an amorphous CoFeB layer during a subsequent annealing step is driven by the (100) MgO tunnel barrier and a major portion (not shown) of the magnetic layer crystallizes in a (100) state to maximize the MR ratio in the MTJ. It should be understood that a thin region (not shown) of a CoFeB magnetic layer 24 which adjoins the PMA layer 23 will have a (111) crystal structure or remains amorphous but the thickness of this thin region may be minimized by including the Ta insertion layer 35. Referring to FIG. 3, a second embodiment is depicted that shows a MTJ 40 wherein the seed layer/PMA layer configuration of the present invention is incorporated in a composite free layer. In other words, the seed layer/PMA layer configuration as defined herein is not limited to a reference (pinned) layer but may be used as any functional or passive layer in a magnetic stack. Preferably, the MTJ in this embodiment has a top spin valve structure in which a seed layer, composite free layer, tunnel barrier, reference layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 22 and PMA layer 23 are retained from the first embodiment but in this case the laminated PMA layer is included in a composite free layer. Reference layer 29 formed on the tunnel barrier is comprised of CoFeB, CoFe, or combinations thereof and may have a well known synthetic anti-parallel (SyAP) configuration (not shown) wherein two ferromagnetic layers such as CoFeB are separated by a coupling layer which is Ru, for example. Tunnel barrier 25 and capping layer 27 are retained from the first embodiment. In an embodiment wherein the free layer comprises a PMA layer having a (Co/X)n structure, each of the plurality of Co layers in the PMA layer has a thickness from 1.5 to 4 Angstroms, and each of the plurality of X layers has a thickness from 4 to 10 Angstroms. Preferably, the tunnel barrier is MgO to maximize the MR ratio in the MTJ 40. Furthermore, the composite free layer 31 may have a seed layer 22/PMA layer 23/magnetic layer 24 configuration where the magnetic layer serves as a transitional layer between the (100) texture in the tunnel barrier layer and the (111) crystal structure in PMA layer 23 to promote a high MR ratio. Preferably, the magnetic layer 24 is made of CoFeB with a thickness of about 6 to 14 Angstroms so that interfacial perpendicular anisotropy dominates shape anisotropy within the layer to result in PMA with a magnetization direction that is aligned in the same z-axis direction as in PMA layer 23. The composite free layer 31 may further include a Ta insertion layer (not shown) formed between PMA layer 23 and magnetic layer 24. Seed layer (underlayer) 22 is preferably one of NiCr, NiFeCr, Hf, Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf with a 5 to 200 Angstrom thickness to enhance the PMA character in PMA layer 23 thereby increasing thermal stability without compromising other free layer properties. Referring to FIG. 4, a third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and depicts a MTJ 50 having a bottom spin valve structure wherein the seed layer/PMA layer of the present invention is employed as a dipole layer to reduce the offset of the minor switching loop of the free layer caused by a dipole field from the reference layer. According to one embodiment, a seed layer, reference layer, tunnel barrier, free layer, spacer, dipole layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 28 may be NiCr or NiFeCr. Reference layer 29 and tunnel barrier layer 25 are retained from the second embodiment. Preferably, the reference layer is thin with a thickness from 5 to 15 Angstroms. Free layer 26 and capping layer 27 were previously described with regard to the first embodiment. In one aspect, a CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer may be employed to provide a high MR ratio. A key feature is the stack of layers formed between the free layer and capping layer. In particular, a non-magnetic spacer 33 made of Ta, for example, contacts a top surface of free layer 26 and getters oxygen from the free layer. Above the spacer is a composite dipole layer 34 including an underlayer 22 that contacts a top surface of the spacer and a PMA layer 23 that interfaces with capping layer 27. Layers 22, 23 retain the same features as described with respect to the first two embodiments except the underlayer is preferably 5 to 100 Angstroms thick in this embodiment. In one aspect, free layer 26 may be sufficiently thin (6 to 15 Angstroms) to have significant interfacial perpendicular anisotropy that dominates an in-plane shape anisotropy field such that a magnetization perpendicular to the plane of the free layer is established. Interfacial perpendicular anisotropy is a result of the interface between a bottom surface of free layer 26 and a top surface of tunnel barrier 25 which is preferably MgO. When the free layer has PMA, the magnetization directions of the free layer and PMA layer 23 are preferably aligned in the same direction. All of the layers in the MTJ elements described herein may be formed in a sputter deposition system such as an Anelva C-7100 thin film sputtering system or the like which typically includes three physical vapor deposition (PVD) chambers each having 5 targets, an oxidation chamber, and a sputter etching chamber. At least one of the PVD chambers is capable of co-sputtering. Typically, the sputter deposition process involves an argon sputter gas with ultra-high vacuum and the targets are made of metal or alloys to be deposited on a substrate. All of the MTJ layers may be formed after a single pump down of the sputter system to enhance throughput. The present invention also encompasses an annealing step after all layers in the spin valve structure have been deposited. The MTJ elements 20, 40, 50 may be annealed by applying a temperature between 300\u00b0 C. and 400\u00b0 C. for a period of 30 minutes to 5 hours using a conventional oven, or for only a few seconds when a rapid thermal anneal oven is employed. No applied magnetic field is necessary during the annealing step because PMA is established in layer 23 due to the seed layer 22 and because of the Co\u0097Ni (or A1-A2) spin orbital interactions in the laminated PMA layer 23. Once all the layers in MTJ elements 20, 40, or 50 are formed, the spin valve stack is patterned into an oval, circular, or other shapes from a top-down perspective along the z-axis by a well known photoresist patterning and reactive ion etch transfer sequence. Thereafter, an insulation layer (not shown) may be deposited on the substrate 21 followed by a planarization step to make the insulation layer coplanar with the capping layer 27. Next, a top electrode (not shown) may be formed on the capping layer. Referring to FIG. 5, an embodiment is depicted wherein the MTJ of the first embodiment is fabricated in a domain wall motion device. In one aspect, composite reference layer 30 is formed in a MTJ stack having a seed layer/reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer/capping layer configuration. A key feature is that seed layer 22 and reference layer 30 have a width along an in-plane x-axis direction that is substantially less than the width of the overlying stack of layers. In fact, the stack of layers including tunnel barrier 25, free layer 26, and capping layer 27 may be patterned to provide a wire which from a top-down view (not shown) is part of an array of wires that are employed for storage of digital information. Another important feature is that free layer 26 has a plurality of domain walls (75 a-75 d) each extending vertically from a top surface that interfaces with layer 27 a to a bottom surface which interfaces with tunnel barrier layer 25. There is a magnetic domain bounded by each pair of domain walls within the composite free layer. The number of domain walls is variable but is selected as four in the exemplary embodiment for illustrative purposes. In particular, the magnetic domain 92 aligned in a z-axis direction above reference layer 30 has a switchable magnetization that changes from a (+) z-direction to a (\u2212) z-direction or vice versa when a switching current is applied during a write process. Note that free layer has two ends 37 e, 37 f connected to a current/voltage source 81 in a first electrical loop including wiring 85 a to a junction 82 to wire 83 and to end 37 e, and a wire 84 attached to end 37 f to enable a write process. Furthermore, there is a second electrical loop which allows a readout of digital information in the switchable magnetic domain 92 during a read process. Thus, current can be sent from source 81 through wires 85 a, 85 b and to readout 80 and then to wire 86 and through reference layer 30, tunnel barrier 25, and free layer 26 before exiting end 37 f and returning to the source to complete a circuit. In so doing, the readout device 80 is able to recognize whether the switchable magnetic domain 92 has a magnetization in a (+) z-axis direction 90 b or in a (\u2212) z-axis direction 90 a. Example 1 An experiment was performed to demonstrate the advantage of a seed layer in improving PMA in an overlying (Co/Ni)n multilayer stack according to the present invention. A partial and unpatterned spin valve stack comprised of a seed layer, a (Co/Ni)10 laminated layer where each Co layer is 2.5 Angstroms thick and each Ni layer is 6 Angstroms thick, and a Ru cap layer was fabricated in order to obtain PMA values from M-H curves using a vibrating sample magnometer (VSM). All Samples were annealed at 350\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. In FIG. 6 a, less than ideal seed layers such as TaN, PtMn, NiFe, and Ru were employed. In FIG. 6 b, 100 Angstrom thick NiCr and Hf seed layers were formed according to the present invention to provide improved performance including squarer M-H loops and higher coercivity (higher PMA) as depicted in curves 41, 42, respectively, compared with the films grown on the inadequate seed layers in FIG. 6 a. Note that a greater distance between the vertical sections of each pair of curves in FIG. 6 b means a higher PMA is achieved. Thus, a NiCr seed layer leads to higher PMA than a Hf seed layer of similar thickness. Referring to FIGS. 7 a-7 b, additional partial spin valve stacks were prepared by sequentially forming a composite seed layer, (Co/Ni)10 laminated layer, and Ru capping layer. Coercivity in an in-plane direction with respect to the film plane is illustrated in FIG. 7 b for a Hf20/NiCr100 seed layer configuration (curve 53) and for a NiCr100/Hf20 seed layer configuration (curve 54). Magnetization or PMA in a perpendicular-to-plane direction is represented for the Hf/NiCr and NiCr/Hf configurations in curves 51, 52, respectively in FIG. 7 a. The resulting laminated films grown on composite seed layers of the present invention show high coercivity and good squareness. Related measurements on single layer seed films show a high saturation field (perpendicular anisotropy) of about 4000 Oe for a Hf underlayer and around 10000 Oe for a NiCr underlayer. Note that in a composite seed layer such as Hf/NiCr, the upper layer which contacts the Co/Ni (or A1-A2) laminate has a larger effect in enhancing PMA in the multilayer than the lower layer contacting the substrate. Since a NiCr underlayer generates a higher PMA than a Hf underlayer (10000 Oe vs. 4000 Oe) as indicated previously, a Hf/NiCr seed layer (curve 51) leads to a higher PMA than a NiCr/Hf seed layer (curve 52) Example 2 To further demonstrate the benefits of the present invention according to a first embodiment where the composite seed layer/laminated PMA layer is formed as a reference layer in a MTJ suitable for spin-torque MRAM devices, a MTJ stack was fabricated as represented in the following stack of layers where the number following each layer is the thickness in Angstroms: Si/SiO2/Ta50/Hf20/NiCr100/(Cu2.5/Ni6)10/Co20Fe60B206/MgO/Co20Fe60B2012/Ta20/Ru. In the aforementioned structure, Si/SiO2 is the substrate, Ta is a bottom electrode, Hf/NiCr is a composite seed layer, (Co/Ni)10 is the laminated PMA portion of the reference layer, CoFeB is the transitional magnetic layer adjoining a MgO tunnel barrier, CoFeB is the free layer, and Ta/Ru is the capping layer. Thus, (Co/Ni)10/Co20Fe60B20 serves as a composite reference layer to provide a high MR ratio wherein the CoFeB portion is thin enough to preserve the PMA property and thick enough to generate a high MR ratio because of cohesive tunneling in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB stack of layers. In addition to promoting a high magneto-resistive ratio, the CoFeB free layer is selected for switching purposes. An anneal process comprising a 300\u00b0 C. temperature treatment for 1 hour was used for this experiment. Referring to FIG. 8, a M-H loop measurement is illustrated for the MTJ stack described above and shows significant PMA as a result of the composite reference layer structure, and an additional PMA contribution from the CoFeB free layer. The steps 61 a, 61 b in the M-H loop indicate the reference layer and free layer switch independently with the reference layer having a much greater coercivity compared with the free layer as revealed by the greater height for step 61 b related to the reference layer. Therefore, the reference layer may serve as a \u0093pinned layer\u0094. Example 3 According to a third embodiment of the present invention, the composite seed layer/laminated PMA layer as described previously may be incorporated as a dipole layer in a MTJ represented in the following stack of layers: Si/SiO2/Ta50/NiCr100/Co20Fe60B203/MgO/Co20Fe60B2012/Ta10/NiCr20/(Cu2.5/Ni6)10/Ru. In the aforementioned structure, Si/SiO2 is the substrate, Ta50 is a 50 Angstrom thick bottom electrode, NiCr100 is a 100 Angstrom thick seed layer, CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB is a reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer configuration, and Ta10 is non-magnetic spacer with a 10 Angstrom thickness between the free layer and a 20 Angstrom thick NiCr underlayer for the laminated PMA structure which is (Co/Ni)10. Ru is a capping layer. Referring to FIG. 9, a M-H loop measurement is depicted that shows magnetization in a direction perpendicular to the film plane of the layers in the aforementioned MTJ stack having a dipole layer. In this case, the dipole layer and free layer both have PMA and switch at different fields allowing the two layers to be set in the desired configuration. Step 71 b for the dipole layer is substantially greater than the step 71 a for the free layer. There is no PMA contribution observed for the reference layer which is purposely kept very thin at 3 Angstroms for this experiment. In a functional MTJ, reference layer thickness is generally maintained between 5 and 15 Angstroms and would exhibit substantial PMA. By reducing the thickness of the Ta spacer between the dipole layer and the free layer, the dipole layer is allowed to provide more offset field to the free layer. Moreover, the thickness of the NiCr underlayer adjoining the Co/Ni laminate may be adjusted to amplify or reduce the offset field applied to the free layer. The MTJ elements described herein feature a seed layer/PMA laminated layer combination which offers enhanced PMA properties together with improved compatibility with high temperature processing, and improved compatibility with the design and fabrication of magnetic devices. As a result, the embodiments of the present invention are suitable for a variety of applications including advanced PMA spin-torque MRAM devices, domain wall motion devices, and in-plane magnetic devices wherein it is beneficial to introduce an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy component as in in-plane spin torque MRAM devices or in partial PMA spin torque MRAM devices. Improved PMA properties include increased Hc and Hk that enable higher thermal stability up to 400\u00b0 C. processing. While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to, the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.",

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of prospecting and more particularly to data processing. Specifically, the invention is a method for modeling subsurface volumes for one or more geophysical properties. The present invention relates generally to the field of hydrocarbon production, and more particularly to the effect of anisotropic formation strength on the drilling of a stable wellbore along a given locus. As a specific example, the present techniques involve a petrophysical method for utilizing geophysical wireline logs to predict the shear strength anisotropy of sub-surface fine-grained rock formations (particularly shales) without having to core and plug the sub-surface formation of interest to directly measure shear strength anisotropy in the laboratory. Predicted anisotropic strength functions are subsequently used in numerical models of the subsurface, including analytical and computational methods for optimizing mud weight design in high-angle/horizontal extended reach wells in which inclinations can approach bed-parallel. BACKGROUND In the oil and gas industry, modeling of the subsurface is typically utilized for visualization and to assist with analyzing the subsurface volume for potential locations for hydrocarbon resources. Accordingly, various methods exist for estimating the geophysical properties of the subsurface volume (e.g., information in the model domain) by analyzing the measurements from measurement equipment (e.g., information in the data domain). The measurements include some information of the geophysical properties that may be utilized to generate the subsurface model. The interpretation of the subsurface volume may be complicated by the rock properties within the subsurface. In particular, interest in the anisotropic strength characteristics exhibited by fine-grained rock formations has resulted primarily from a desire to understand wellbore failure mechanisms associated with drilling through shales. Although elastic anisotropy in shales can impact wellbore failure through the redistribution of borehole stresses, analytical studies have shown that strength anisotropy has a more significant control. See e.g., Gazaniol, D., T. Forsans, M. J. F. Boisson and J.-M. Piau. 1995. Wellbore failure mechanisms in shales: Prediction and prevention. J. Pet. Tech. July 1995: 589-595. This effect is particularly pronounced for extended reach drilling (ERD) where the borehole trajectory can achieve near-parallelism with weak bedding planes, as shown in FIG. 1. If the attack angle is low (e.g., approximately 70 to 90\u00b0 borehole inclination through a formation with approximately (\u2248) 0\u00b0 dip angle) interaction between the borehole hoop stress (\u03c3\u03b8 in FIG. 1) and the anisotropic formation can result in oblique loading of the relatively weak bedding laminations leading to premature shear failure. This failure mechanism is often attributed to the invasion of drilling fluids into micro-fractures along bedding planes, which is not necessarily the cause. See, e.g., Ottesen, S. 2010. Wellbore stability in fractured rock. In Proceedings of the IADC/SPE Drilling Conference, New Orleans, 2-4 Feb. 2010. Depending on the relative magnitudes of anisotropic rock strength and borehole stress concentration, breakouts may occur at unexpected positions around the borehole different from the more typical elliptical elongation conventionally found in isotropic rock. See, e.g., Willson, S. M., S. T. Edwards, A. Crook, A. Bere, D. Moos, P. Peska and N. Last. 2007. Assuring stability in extended-reach wells\u0097Analyses, practices and mitigations. In Proceedings of the IADC/SPE Drilling Conference, Amsterdam, 20-22 Feb. 2007. For optimally orientated positions around the borehole circumference, failure may occur via oblique loading of the planes of weakness (intra-laminar failure) before failure can occur within the bulk material cutting through the planes of weakness (trans-laminar failure), necessitating higher mud weights to reduce stress concentration on weak bedding planes, or else limiting wellbore inclination. As the recovery of natural resources, such as hydrocarbons rely, in part, on a subsurface model, a need exists to enhance subsurface models of one or more geophysical properties. In particular, a technique for predicting the degree of shear strength anisotropy encountered in fine-grained rock formations (including shales) without recourse to costly and time consuming laboratory measurements is needed. The technique may preferably be suited for utilizing geophysical wireline logs as input data to the predictive technique for evaluating strength anisotropy. The technique calculates a lithology-dependent anisotropic failure criterion that can subsequently be input into analytical or computational methods for optimizing mud weight design in ERD wells. See, e.g., Ottesen, S., R. H. Zheng and R. C. McCann. 1999. Borehole stability assessment using quantitative risk analysis. In Proceedings of the IADC/SPE Drilling Conference, Amsterdam, 9-11 Mar. 1999 and Pande, G. N., G. Beer and J. R. Williams. 1990. Numerical Methods In Rock Mechanics. John Wiley & Sons, NY.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description section, the specific embodiments of the present disclosure are described in connection with preferred embodiments. However, to the extent that the following description is specific to a particular embodiment or a particular use of the present disclosure, this is intended to be for exemplary purposes only and simply provides a description of the exemplary embodiments. Accordingly, the disclosure is not limited to the specific embodiments described below, but rather, it includes all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents falling within the true spirit and scope of the appended claims. Various terms as used herein are defined below. To the extent a term used in a claim is not defined below, it should be given the broadest definition persons in the pertinent art have given that term as reflected in at least one printed publication or issued patent. Further, various terms and reference characters that are the same are utilized in the equations and associated description within the disclosure. The present disclosure describes methods and systems to enhance subsurface models. The present techniques relates generally to the field of hydrocarbon production, and more particularly to the effect of anisotropic formation strength on the drilling of a stable wellbore along a given locus. To enhance these production operations, a petrophysical method may be based on geophysical wireline logs to predict the shear strength anisotropy of sub-surface fine-grained rock formations (e.g., shales) without having to core and plug the sub-surface formation of interest to directly measure shear strength anisotropy in the laboratory. Then, the predicted anisotropic strength functions are used in numerical models of the subsurface, including analytical and computational methods for optimizing mud weight design in high-angle/horizontal extended reach wells in which inclinations approach may be bed-parallel. In conventional techniques, the direct measurement of anisotropy may be performed using core samples. Knowledge of shale anisotropy has been significantly advanced by the geophysics community through the analysis of seismic wave propagation (e.g., incorporating anisotropy into migration algorithms to provide for proper positioning of reflectors, [6]) such that the majority of experimental and theoretical investigations have focused on determining elastic anisotropy in shale formations. See, e.g., Cholach, P. Y. and D. R. Schmitt 2003. Intrinsic anisotropy of shales. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Dallas, 26-31 Oct. 2003 and Sondergeld, C. H. and C. S. Rai. 2011. Elastic anisotropy of shale. The Leading Edge March 2011. By comparison with this relatively advanced understanding of elastic anisotropy, research into shale strength anisotropy has received much less attention. This observation may partly reflect the fact that many more test samples are required to quantify strength as opposed to elastic anisotropy, which is discussed further below. Nevertheless, numerous experimental studies have sought to investigate anisotropic strength of rocks with strong planar geologic fabrics including: slate; schist and gneiss; shale and mudstone; siltstone; sandstone; limestone; and coal.

Conventional techniques for quantifying both elastic and strength anisotropy involve direct measurement of mechanical properties utilizing orientated core samples. The directional character of the deformational properties of anisotropic media is commonly analyzed in terms of the theory of elasticity using the 3D generalized form of Hooke's law. Expressed via the compliance matrix, the rock then has twenty-one independent elastic constants. See, e.g., Jaeger, J. C., N. G. W. Cook and R. W. Zimmerman. Fundamentals of Rock Mechanics. 4th Edn. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, MA. However, for most practical cases, anisotropic rocks are usually modeled as transversely isotropic media, implying that at each point in the rock there is an axis of rotational symmetry and that the rock has isotropic properties in the plane normal to that axis, in which case only five independent elastic constants are required to fully describe elastic deformability. As shown in diagram 200 of FIG. 2A, one conventional approach for experimental characterization of transverse isotropy is to assume a symmetry axis 202, extract orientated plugs in vertical orientation (e.g., vertical plug 204 having an orientation angle of \u03b2=0\u00b0), horizontal orientation (e.g., horizontal plug 206 having an orientation angle of \u03b2=90\u00b0) and mid-angle orientation (e.g., mid-angle plug 208 having an orientation angle of \u03b2=45\u00b0) and directly measure either the axial and longitudinal strains or the corresponding acoustic velocities associated with these three orientations. See, e.g., Thomsen, L. 1986. Weak elastic anisotropy. Geophysics 51(10): 1954-1966 and Amadei, B. 1996. Importance of anisotropy when estimating and measuring in situ stress in rock. Int. J. Rock Mech. & Min. Sci. 33(3): 293-325. This orientated core plug for direct measurement of elastic anisotropy is shown in diagram 200 of FIG. 2A, While plasticity (e.g., deformation beyond the limit of purely elastic strain), theories for anisotropic geologic materials have also been explored, but by comparison with elastic anisotropy it is less clear how such theories should be utilized to define rational material properties testing procedures. See e.g., Pariseau, W. G. 1968. Plasticity theory for anisotropic rocks and soil. In Proceedings 10th US Symposium on Rock Mechanics, Austin, 20-22 May 1968. As shown in the diagram 250 of FIG. 2B, experimental studies designed to quantify continuous variation in strength with orientation angle (\u03b2) (defined as the angle between the normal to the planar layering and the direction of maximum compressive stress \u03c31) typically utilized plugs cored in 15\u00b0 increments from the vertical (e.g., orientation angle of \u03b2=0\u00b0) to the horizontal (e.g., orientation angle of \u03b2=90\u00b0) direction such that a total of seven orientated core plugs (e.g., having angle of orientations of 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) are utilized for each lithology. As multiple additional plugs are also necessary for each orientation angle to determine strengthening associated with elevated confining pressure \u03c33, it is apparent that complete characterization of strength anisotropy can involve an order of magnitude more core tests than equivalent characterization of elastic anisotropy. Geographically-diverse examples of anisotropic rock strength models derived from direct core measurement being used to optimize drilling programs include: Gulf of Mexico; Canada; Venezuela and Colombia; UK continental shelf; and the Middle East.

In addition to the costly and time consuming nature of deriving shale strength anisotropy from direct core measurement, another distinct disadvantage relates to the potential for inducing damage in such low permeability, fine-grained rocks due to rapid exhumation of core from great depth to the surface. See, e.g., Holt, R. M. 1994. Effects of coring on petrophysical measurements. In Proceedings of the Society of Core Analysts Annual Technical Conference, Stavangar, 1994. The associated permanent microstructural alteration (resulting from diverse mechanisms including in situ stress and pore pressure release, temperature reduction, desiccation, exposure to non-native drilling fluids and poor handling and preservation techniques) can lead to spurious measurement of shale strength anisotropy unrepresentative of that associated with subsurface conditions. See, e.g., Santarelli, F. J. 1994. Similarities and differences between wellbore stability and sand production. In North Sea Oil and Gas Reservoirs\u0097III, 30 Nov.-2 Dec., eds. Aasen, J. O., E. Berg, A. T. Buller, O. Hjelmeland, R. M. Holt, J. Kleppe and O. Torsxter, 331-338. Dordrecht: Kluwer. Experimentally determined strength data, \u03c31=f(\u03c33, \u03b2), may then be used to calibrate various anisotropic failure criteria. Numerous such criteria have been proposed to capture the deformation behavior of anisotropic rocks under different loading conditions. Duveau et al summarize many of these criteria and categorize them into distinct groups. See, e.g., Duveau, G., J. F. Shao and J. P. Henry, 1998, Assessment of some failure criteria for strongly anisotropic rocks. Mech. Cohes-frict. Mater. 3: 1-26. The first group includes discontinuous criteria such as the single plane of weakness (SPW) model. In criteria of this form, there is a distinction between failure on a weak plane (such as a bedding or lamination plane) and failure of the bulk material (where the failure surface cuts through such planes of weakness). With this theory the strength of the rock is uniform with respect to orientation if the failure does not occur on a weak plane and variable if it does. Results for this simplest example of planar anisotropy can be based on the well-known two-dimensional theory for sliding on a plane of weakness whose normal makes an orientation angle \u03b2 with the maximum principal stress, \u03c31-direction. See, e.g., Jaeger. If the plane of weakness has strength properties \u03c40 w is the cohesive strength and \u03c6w is the angle of internal friction, the criterion for failure in the plane of weakness is given by the well-known linear Coulomb criterion. See, e.g., Coulomb, C. A. 1773. Application des regles de maxima et minima a quelques problemes de statique relatifs a 1\u2032 architecture. [application of the rules of maxima and minima to some problems of statics related to architecture]. Acad. Roy. Sci. Mem. Math. Phys. 7: 343-382. The linear Coulomb criterion is shown by the following Equation (1). |\u03c4|=\u03c40 w+\u03c3n tan \u03c6w\u2003\u2003Equation (1) where the shear stress \u03c4 and normal stress \u03c3n on the weakness plane are determined by the maximum and minimum principal stresses (\u03c31 and \u03c33 respectively) and the orientation angle \u03b2 according to the following Equations 2 and 3: \u03c4 = - 1 2 \ue89e ( \u03c3 1 - \u03c3 3 ) \ue89e sin \ue89e \ue89e 2 \ue89e \u03b2 Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 2 ) \u03c3 n = 1 2 \ue89e ( \u03c3 1 + \u03c3 3 ) + 1 2 \ue89e ( \u03c3 1 - \u03c3 3 ) \ue89e cos \ue89e \ue89e 2 \ue89e \u03b2 Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 3 ) Substituting Equation (2) and Equation (3) into Equation (1) enables determination of the maximum principal stress difference (\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) sustainable by the plane of weakness before failure, for a given orientation angle \u03b2: This is provided in Equation (4) below. (\u03c31\u2212\u03c33)=2(\u03c40 w+\u03c33 tan \u03c6w)/((1\u2212tan \u03c6w cot \u03b2)sin 2\u03b2)\u2003\u2003Equation (4) As given by Equation (4), the stress difference at failure (\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) tends to infinity as \u03b2\u2192\u02dd \u03c0 and as \u03b2\u2192\u03c6w. Between these values, failure of the plane of weakness is possible and has a minimum value at \u03b2min w given as given by Equation (5): \u03b2 min w = 90 \ue89e \u00b0 - 1 2 \ue89e tan - 1 \ue8a0 ( cot \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 w ) Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 5 ) This is the orientation most favorable for failure. However, for unfavorable values of orientation angle \u03b2, failure may take place through the bulk material on a plane which cuts across the plane of weakness. If the Coulomb criterion is again utilized to describe bulk failure with material properties \u03c40 b is the cohesive strength in the bulk material and \u03c6b is the angle of internal friction in the bulk material, failure occurs based on the same criterion as the weak plane (Equation (1)), but with the maximum principal stress difference (\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) sustainable by the bulk material before failure now given by Equation (6): ( \u03c3 1 - \u03c3 3 ) = 2 [ \u03c4 0 b \ue89e cot \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 b + 1 2 \ue89e ( \u03c3 1 + \u03c3 3 ) ] \ue89e sin \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 b Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 6 ) The induced shear failure plane within the bulk material is orientated such that its outward normal forms an acute angle \u03b2b with the maximum principal stress direction where: \u03b2 b = 1 4 \ue89e \u03c0 + \u03d5 b / 2 Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 7 ) The SPW model therefore predicts that, for a given value of \u03c33, the magnitude of \u03c31 required to induce failure somewhere within the anisotropic rock is equal to the lesser of the two values as defined by Equation (4) and Equation (6). If, for a given orientation angle \u03b2, the value given by Equation (4) is less than that given by Equation (6), failure occurs along the plane of weakness. Conversely, if the value given by Equation (4) is greater than that given by Equation (6), the induced shear failure plane within the intact rock cuts through the plane of weakness at an orientation as given by Equation (7). It is evident from Equation (4) that the variation of (\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) with orientation angle \u03b2 has the same form for each of the values of \u03c33, but with a different multiplying factor. The nature of this variation is illustrated in the graph 300 of FIG. 3 in which the magnitude of \u03c31 that causes failure is plotted as a function of orientation angle \u03b2 for four values of \u03c33. This graph 300 is an example of single plane of weakness (SPW) model illustrating variation of the maximum principal stress \u03c31 that induces failure shown along the stress axis 302 in Mega Pascals (MPa) as a function of orientation angle \u03b2 shown along the angle axis 304 in degrees between the normal to the plane of weakness and the \u03c31-direction, for four different minimum principal stress \u03c33 magnitudes, and strength parameters: \u03c40 b is 10 Mega Pascals (MPa); \u03c6b is 33\u00b0; \u03c40 w is 5 MPa; and \u03c6w is 28\u00b0. The different minimum principal stress \u03c33 magnitudes are 20.68 MPa for response 305 a, 13.79 MPa for response 305 b, 3.45 MPa for response 305 c, and 0 MPa for response 305 d. In the graph 300, the concave-upwards portions of each curve, such as portions 306 a, 306 b, 306 c and 306 d, correspond to the criterion given by Equation (4) and represent \u03b2-dependent failure along the plane of weakness. The horizontal portions of each curve are derived from Equation (6) and represent O-independent failure within the intact rock along a plane defined by Equation (7). While the advantages of the SPW model are that it is theoretically-based and fully-described using only four material parameters (\u03c40 b, \u03c6b, \u03c40 w, \u03c6w) the considerable disadvantage of this criterion is illustrated schematically in FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is flow diagram 400 of the classification of anisotropy types based on the shape of the strength versus orientation profile. FIG. 4 is modified from Ramamurthy, T. 1993. Strength and modulus response of anisotropic rocks. In Comprehensive Rock Engineering Vol. I, ed. J. Hudson, 313-329. In this flow diagram 400, various blocks indicate differentiating criteria to classify the types of anisotropy. For example, the types of anisotropy are described in block 402, which divide into a cleavage type in block 404 and a bedding type in block 412. The cleavage type may exhibit a maximum strength at orientation angle \u03b2 equal to 0\u00b0, which is utilized to divide the types into a U Type in block 407 (e.g., associated with profile 417) and an Undulatory Type in block 410 (e.g., associated with profile 418). The bedding type may include exhibiting maximum strength at orientation angle \u03b2 equal to 90\u00b0, as shown in block 414. Then, the shoulder type may be determined as shown in block 416 (e.g., associated with profile 419). These classifications may be provided as a profile, such as profiles 417, 418 and 419, which compare the strength versus orientation for each profile. Although some experimental results (particularly for slates) show general agreement with the SPW model, as shown in profile 417, many anisotropic sedimentary rocks exhibit pronounced asymmetry in the shape of their strength \u03c31 versus orientation angle \u03b2 profiles which cannot be satisfactorily modeled using the SPW criterion, as shown in profiles 418 and 419. A second category of anisotropic failure criteria distinguished by Duveau includes those models which describe a continuous variation in strength with orientation such that no explicit distinction is made between failure along planes of weakness and failure of the bulk material. In one such formulation, Jaeger generalized the well-known Coulomb theory for shear failure to the case in which cohesive strength \u03c40 was not constant but varied with orientation angle \u03b2. See, e.g., Jaeger, J. C. 1960. Shear failure of anisotropic rocks. Geol. Mag. 97: 65-72. The equation is shown below in Equation (8): \u03c40 =A*\u2212B*cos 2(\u03b2\u2212\u03b2min)\u2003\u2003Equation (8) where A* and B* are fitting parameters and \u03b2min is the orientation angle at which cohesive strength exhibits a functional minimum. In this variable cohesive strength (VCS) model, the associated internal friction angle \u03c6 is not directly specified, but is assumed to be independent of direction. Because the VCS model uses a periodic (cosine) function to fit cohesive strength data and Coulomb theory predicts that \u03b2min=45+\u03c6/2 (Equation (7)), such that \u03b2min\u226745\u00b0, it follows that the magnitude of \u03c40 at the orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0 is greater than that at the orientation angle \u03b2=90\u00b0. This is a constraint placed by the model that does not represent the observed variation in strength for many anisotropic rock types. McLamore et al. expanded upon the VCS model by postulating additional periodic variation in friction angle with orientation and allowing both cohesion and friction angle to have dependence on a cosine function raised to a power n, as shown in Equation (9): (\u03c40,\u03c6)=A 1,2\u2212\u03b21,2[cos 2(\u03b2\u2212\u03b2min)]n\u2003\u2003Equation (9) where A1 and B1 are \u03c40 and \u03c6-specific empirical constants that describe the behavior of \u03c40 and \u03c6 over the range 0\u00b0\u2266\u03b2\u2266\u03b2min and A2 and B2 the equivalent empirical constants for the range \u03b2min\u2266\u03b2\u226690\u00b0. The terms A1,2 and B1,2 represent A1 or A2 and B1 or B2 for different equations of this terms. It is therefore evident that Equation (9) requires a total of twelve empirically determined constants to fully describe strength anisotropy. Both the SPW and VCS anisotropic failure criteria detailed above can only be determined for a specific subsurface lithology of interest through orientated triaxial compression testing of recovered core, to directly measure \u03c31 equal f(\u03c33, \u03b2) data that can subsequently be used to calibrate each model. Although the modified VCS model of McLamore et al. offer increased congruency with experimental data, utilization of this criterion for describing strength anisotropy in a subsurface lithology of interest for which no core was available for geomechanics testing, involves having to predict the requisite twelve empirical constants which poses a considerable challenge. With regard to predictive techniques, as rock strength is directly quantified from laboratory testing, core recovery issues dictate that many geomechanical problems have to be addressed in the absence of samples. Accordingly, there exists a plethora of empirical equations in the literature for relating mechanical strength properties to other physical properties potentially derivable from geophysical wireline logs, which can be utilized when no core is available for testing. Mechanical properties evaluation is primarily based on application of the most appropriate of these pre-determined predictors to logs derived from the subsurface strata of interest, calibrated where possible against limited core measurements often from offset wells. Most empirical predictors are explicit to particular rock types (e.g., sandstone, carbonate or shale) and the majority relates rock strength to either acoustic velocities, the equivalent dynamic elastic moduli, or porosity. Predicted strength parameters are predominantly those that describe the linear Coulomb-type failure criterion (as noted in Coulomb), specifically unconfined compressive strength (UCS), cohesive strength \u03c40 and internal friction angle \u03c6. Comprehensive summaries of numerous such empirical equations sourced from the literature that relate rock strength parameters to other physical properties are given in Change and Khakar. See, e.g., Chang, C., M. D. Zoback and A. Khaksar. 2006. Empirical relations between rock strength and physical properties in sedimentary rocks. J. Pet. Sci. & Eng. 51: 223-237 and Khaksar, A., P. G. Taylor, Z. Fang, T. Kayes, A. Salazar and K. Rahman. 2009. Rock strength from core and logs: where we stand and ways to go. Proceedings of the SPE EUROPEC/EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition, Amsterdam, 8-11 Jun. 2009. By way of an example for shales, several references describe robust negative power law relationships between UCS and porosity, while others describe positive correlations between UCS and compressional sonic velocity. However, as strength is controlled by complex rock fabric on the microscale, oftentimes core-derived rock strength data can show considerable variation as a function of single input parameters, such as velocity, elastic modulus or porosity, such that most empirical predictors are not sufficiently generic to fit all published strength versus physical property data. See, e.g., Lashkaripour, G. R., and M. B. Dusseault. 1993. A statistical study on shale properties: relationship among principal shale properties. In Proceedings of the Conference on Probabilistic Methods in Geotechnical Engineering, Canberra, 10-12 February; Horsrud, P. 2001.

Top-seal leakage through faults and fractures: the role of mudrock properties. In, Muds and Mudstones: Physical and Fluid Flow Properties. Geological Society London, Special Publications, 158: 125-135. Multi-variate algorithms can offer improved congruency with experimental data, for example Coulomb strength parameters in sandstone-to-shale siliciclastic rocks can be predicted from algorithms relating \u03c40 and \u03c6 to porosity and lithology, the latter defined by total clay content which can be directly quantified by the X-ray diffraction XRD technique or derived from petrophysical analysis of wireline logs. See, e.g., United States Patent Application No. 2011/0015907, Publication Date: Jan. 20, 2011. Another shale-specific strength predictor correlates shale strength to surface area as derived from the dielectric constant measurement (DCM) technique. See, e.g., Leung, P. K. and Steiger, R. P. 1992. Dielectric constant measurements: a new, rapid method to characterize shale at the wellsite. Proceedings of the IADC/SPE Drilling Conference, New Orleans, 18-21 Feb. 1992. Shale surface area represents a measure of the total fraction of swelling clays and DCM can be readily performed on drilling cuttings. An extensive shale strength database acquired through consolidated undrained triaxial testing may be compiled to develop the predictive regression which relates shale strength (octahedral shear stress at failure) to mean effective stress and shale surface area. See, e.g., Steiger, R. P. and P. K. Leung. 1992. Quantitative determination of the mechanical properties of shales. SPE Drilling & Completion, 7: 181-185. Implicit in the above predictive techniques is that strength properties are derived from databases of laboratory measurements in which core testing is conducted on samples with any planar geologic fabric orientated perpendicular to the direction of maximum compressive stress (e.g., at orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0), such that predicted mechanical properties relate specifically to bulk (trans-laminar) strength in which induced failure planes cut across bedding laminations, so that these techniques offer no predictive capability for quantifying strength anisotropy associated with the presence of such weakness planes. Compared with the relatively numerous bulk strength predictive techniques that have been developed via calibration with laboratory data as described above, techniques for predicting strength anisotropy without recourse to core testing are relatively few. As an example, Willson et al proposed a formulation for describing unconfined compressive strength (UCS) variation relative to bedding orientation, in which the level of strength anisotropy is characterized via two constants in Equations (10) and (11): k 1=UCS\u2225/UCS\u22a5\u2003\u2003Equation (10) k 2=UCSmin/UCSmax\u2003\u2003Equation (11) In Equation (10) UCS\u2225 is the strength with bedding parallel to the \u03c31-direction (\u03b2=90\u00b0) and UCS\u22a5 is the strength with bedding perpendicular to the \u03c31-direction (e.g., orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0) and in Equation (11) UCSmin is the minimum strength for any orientation and UCSmax the maximum strength for any orientation. To derive a smoothly varying strength profile with orientation angle the following assumptions were made: UCS\u22a5=UCSmax; UCSmin occurs at orientation angle \u03b2=45\u00b0. Based on these assumptions the following orientation-dependent unconfined compressive strength variation was proposed: UCS(\u03b2)=UCSmax(cos \u03c6+k 1 sin \u03b2)(1\u2212sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2)[1\u22122 sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2(1\u22124k 2/\u221a{square root over (2)}(1+k 1))]\u2003\u2003Equation (12) Equation (12) describes strength anisotropy from knowledge of only three direct measurements (UCS\u2225, UCS\u22a5 and UCSmin). While UCS\u22a5 is potentially predictable from empirical correlations with geophysical wireline measurements (for example porosity or acoustic velocities, see, e.g., Chang) some recovered core from the subsurface strata of interest may be available for direct laboratory measurement of UCS\u2225 and UCSmin. In addition, knowledge of unconfined compressive strength (\u03c33=0) alone is insufficient for determining anisotropic strength at elevated confining pressures (e.g., \u03c33>0), which requires additional information regarding the magnitude of the associated internal friction angle \u03c6. Another disadvantage relates to the form of this orientation-dependent unconfined compressive strength variation, which due to the imposed assumptions, is constrained to always predict UCSmin at orientation angle \u03b2=45\u00b0 and UCS\u2225 at orientation angle (\u03b2=90\u00b0) less than UCS\u22a5 at orientation angle (\u03b2=0\u00b0) for all fine-grained rock types, which is not in agreement with many experimental observations, as noted above in the discussion associated with FIG. 4. Smith and Goldman describe a technique for assaying the compressive strength of rock, primarily based upon a database of laboratory measurements from which strength versus porosity correlations are extracted. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,399. While the technique mainly addresses unconfined compressive strength, the present techniques expand this to accommodate other factors that impact rock strength, such as confining stress, bedding plane orientation and temperature. Due to the predictive methodology underlying the technique, ideally calibration involving laboratory testing of pure lithologies (e.g., clean sandstone and/or shale) recovered from the well of interest is required. However, lithologically similar samples (perhaps from offset wells) may suffice. The technique has limitations when used to predict strength in mixed lithologies, such as shaly sandstones or sandy shales, as it relies on a weighted average of the pure end member components which can lead to significant predictive uncertainty. In the present techniques, the strength versus orientation relationship is represented by a curve corresponding to an equation of the form in Equation (13): \u03c3co =S e[\u03c3umax+\u0394\u03c3max(\u03c33/\u03c33max)\u03b2](1\u2212c omax)+(1\u2212S e)[\u03c3umin+\u0394\u03c3min(\u03c33/\u03c33max)\u03b2](1\u2212c omin)\u2003\u2003Equation (13) where, for 0\u00b0<\u03b2\u2266\u03b2c: \u03b3=(\u03b2/\u03b2c)\u03c0/2 f1=(\u03c3\u03b2=0\u2212\u03c3\u03b2=\u03b2c)/\u03c3\u03b2=0, at zero porosity f2=f1 at maximum porosity comax=f1 sinn(\u03b3) comin=f2 sinn(\u03b3) and for \u03b2c<\u03b2\u226690\u00b0: \u03b3=\u03c0/2+(\u03b2\u2212\u03b2c)/(1\u2212\u03b2c2/\u03c0) f3=(\u03c3\u03b2=90\u2212\u03c3\u03b2=0)/\u03c3\u03b2=0, at zero porosity f4=f3 at maximum porosity comax=(f1+f3)sinn(\u03b3)\u2212f3 comin=(f2+f4)sinn(\u03b3)\u2212f4 and: \u03c3\u221e=compressive strength adjusted for confining pressure and orientation comax=maximum orientation correction at zero porosity comin=minimum orientation correction at zero porosity f1=maximum percent reduction in compressive strength at critical relative dip angle (\u03b2=\u03b2c as compared to \u03b2=0\u00b0) at zero porosity f2=maximum percent reduction in compressive strength at critical relative dip angle (\u03b2=\u03b2c as compared to \u03b2=0\u00b0) at maximum porosity f3=maximum percent increase in compressive strength parallel to dip angle (\u03b2=90\u00b0 as compared to \u03b2=0\u00b0) at zero porosity f4=maximum percent increase in compressive strength parallel to dip angle (\u03b2=90\u00b0 as compared to \u03b2=0\u00b0) at maximum porosity Se=(1\u2212\u03c6/\u03c6max)\u03b1 \u03c6=porosity \u03c6max=maximum porosity \u03b1=a mineralogy value \u03b2=orientation angle of normal to bedding planes \u03b2c=critical orientation angle where compressive strength reaches a minimum value \u03b3=sine function parameter derived from relative dip angle that reaches a maximum value of \u03c0/2 when \u03b2=\u03b2c \u03c3\u03b2=compressive strength at a specific relative dip angle, \u03b2 n=an orientation exponent The advantage of the present techniques is that knowing the general form of Equation (13) as well as the general form of its representation as a curve (a conjunction of portions of two different sine waves) provides characterization of the full-range of experimentally observed orientation-dependent compressive strength variations, including asymmetric profiles, as shown schematically in profiles 418 and 419 of FIG. 4. In the present techniques, the strength prediction may be limited to correlations using porosity alone as data input, and precludes the use of other log-based strength correlations that may be more appropriate for a given lithology or region (generally field-, geologic age- or depth-specific) such as acoustic velocity and DCM predictors. Disadvantages to utilizing existing porosity-based shale strength predictors are detailed below. Direct porosity measurement in fine-grained rock formations, such as shales, is difficult to accomplish using traditional core analysis methods (such as, Mercury injection, Dean Stark solvent extraction or Boyle's law Helium porosimetry) due to the large impact of coring-induced microcracking and fluid invasion effects. To overcome this, typical analysis is performed on crushed rock samples to eliminate coring-induced artifacts while maintaining representation of pore structure. However, measured porosity can still exhibit considerable dependency on the measurement technique due to difficulties in discriminating free and bound water. See, e.g., Handwerger, D. A., R. Suarez-Rivera, K. I. Vaughn and J. F. Keller. 2011. Improved petrophysical core measurements on tight shale reservoirs using retort and crushed samples. In Proceedings of the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, 30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2011. Also, petrophysical techniques for deriving porosity from geophysical wireline logs are typically only calibrated against core measurements derived from the reservoir section, so that log-based porosity in intervening shale sections may be prone to considerable error without additional advanced interpretation. The present techniques involve predicting the degree of shear strength anisotropy encountered in subsurface fine-grained rock formations (particularly shales) without recourse to coring the subsurface strata of interest and performing laboratory strength measurements. The present techniques use a pre-established database of strength measurements derived from orientated core testing to develop predictive algorithms relating parameters describing the degree of strength anisotropy associated with diverse geologic planes of weakness (such as bedding, lamination or cleavage planes) to bulk strength properties easily derived from geophysical wireline logs using a variety of established petrophysical techniques. With regard to planar geologic fabrics in sedimentary rocks, the terms \u0093bedding\u0094 and \u0093lamination\u0094 refer to stratification thicker than 1 centimeter (cm) and thinner than 1 cm, respectively. However, both may be defined by changes in sediment grain-size, color or mineralogical composition, such that the terms may be used interchangeably to imply planes of weakness in sedimentary rocks resulting from changes in the pattern of sedimentation. Similarly, with regard to foliated textures in metamorphic rocks, the terms \u0093slaty cleavage\u0094, \u0093schistosity\u0094 and \u0093gneissic mineral banding\u0094 refer to specific fabrics associated with increasing metamorphic grade (pressure and temperature conditions). However, they represent the preferential alignment of minerals within a directional stress field, such that the terms may be used interchangeably to imply planes of weakness in metamorphic rocks resulting from preferential alignment of platy minerals such as chlorite, muscovite and biotite, or the segregation banding of granular and platy mineral concentrations. As long as the subsurface strata of interest are broadly lithologically similar to a particular fine-grained rock type characterized in the database, then the pre-established predictive algorithms can be utilized to generate subsurface anisotropic strength parameters, without direct incorporation of orientated core measurements from the subsurface strata of interest within the database. For example, if the pre-established database contains mainly orientated strength measurements conducted on sedimentary shales, then it cannot be used to generate subsurface anisotropic strength parameters in metamorphic slates, and vice versa. The present techniques may involve obtaining relationships between planes of weakness and bulk material strength for a plurality of rock samples; obtaining bulk strength of target rock (e.g., well logs, pre-established techniques, etc.); calculating the planes of weakness for the target rock (strength anisotropy); and using the results to enhance models, which may be used for wellbore stability analysis or enhancing recovery. The method for predicting strength anisotropy in fine-grained subsurface formations may include various steps. For example, the method may include compiling a database of core-based strength measurements over a range of orientations and confining pressures for a plurality of fine-grained rock formations; utilizing an automated surface fitting procedure to determine a common 3D anisotropic failure criterion for all database rocks; developing predictive algorithms relating anisotropy parameters in 3D failure criterion and equivalent bulk strength properties; generating subsurface bulk strength properties in strata of interest using established petrophysical techniques; utilizing pre-established predictive algorithms and subsurface bulk strength properties to calculate equivalent anisotropic strength properties in subsurface strata of interest; utilizing predicted anisotropic rock strength for subsurface strata of interest in numerical models of the subsurface. As an example, a workflow is shown in the flow chart 500 of FIG. 5, which is also described further below. The workflow is shown schematically in FIG. 5 and includes: compiling a database of orientated triaxially compressive strength measurements for a plurality of fine-grained rock formations, as shown in block 502; utilizing an automated surface fitting procedure to generate a common 3D anisotropic failure criterion for each fine-grained rock formation, as shown in block 504; developing predictive algorithms relating the anisotropic strength parameters describing the 3D anisotropic failure criterion for each fine-grained rock formation and their equivalent bulk strength properties, as shown in block 506; statistical tools may be utilized to evaluate the goodness of fit between the observed and predicted strength values, as shown in decision block 508; in the event the statistical tool determines that no good fit is shown, the database of rock measurements and/or the predictive algorithm may be adjusted; in the event the statistical tool determines that a good fit is established, the process continues by generating bulk strength properties in the subsurface strata of interest using a variety of established petrophysical techniques, as shown in block 510; utilizing the predictive algorithms pre-established from the database (block 506) and the bulk strength properties in the subsurface strata of interest (block 510) to determine the equivalent anisotropic strength properties in the subsurface strata of interest, as shown in block 512; utilizing the predicted anisotropic rock strength properties (block 512) of the subsurface strata of interest in numerical models of the subsurface, including analytical and computational methods for optimizing mud weight design in ERD wells, as shown in block 514. The present techniques provide various enhancements over other methods. For example, the present techniques predict the degree of shear strength anisotropy encountered in subsurface fine-grained rock formations (particularly shales) without recourse to coring the subsurface strata of interest and performing laboratory strength measurements. Also, the present techniques predict anisotropic strength functions that can subsequently be used in numerical models of the subsurface, including analytical and computational methods for optimizing mud weight design in high-angle/horizontal extended reach wells in which inclinations can approach bed-parallel. The present techniques also utilize bulk strength properties to predict anisotropic failure criteria without any restrictions on the source of the bulk strength properties (directly measured on core, or estimated from geophysical wireline logs or cuttings/cavings analyses). Further, the techniques are not restricted to any one specific anisotropic failure criterion (predicts any discontinuous or continuous model) or anisotropic rock type (predicts any fine-grained rock with either a planar sedimentary fabric or foliated metamorphic texture). Moreover, the present techniques incorporate standard analysis of variance statistical tools in the predictive workflow. Further still, the techniques provide a simple index for comparing the magnitude of strength anisotropy between diverse fine-grained rock types. To further describe the present techniques, various aspects are described further in FIGS. 1 to 5, which are noted above, and FIGS. 5 to 20. As noted above, the flow chart 500 in FIG. 5 includes various blocks to perform one embodiment of the present techniques. In block 502, a compilation of a database of triaxially compressive strength measurements derived from laboratory testing of core plugs sourced from a plurality of fine-grained rocks is compiled. Fine-grained rocks are specifically preferred as such lithologies (for example clay-rich argillaceous shales, carbonate rich calcareous marls, metamorphic slates etc.) tend to exhibit the greatest degree of strength anisotropy associated with relatively weak planar geologic fabrics such as bedding, lamination or cleavage planes, by comparison with coarse-grained unconsolidated sand, sandstone and carbonate formations. Preferably, the majority of fine-grained rock formations included in the database should be of broadly similar lithology to the subsurface strata of interest. Preferably, the database should include a statistically significant number of fine-grained rock formations. Strength data included in the database for each fine-grained rock formation includes maximum axial compressive strength \u03c31 measured over a range of confining pressure \u03c33 magnitudes at different orientation angles \u03b2 (defined as the angle between the normal to the planar layering and the direction of maximum compressive stress \u03c31). Preferably, for each fine-grained rock formation, a series of orientated, triaxially compressive strength tests should be conducted for at least seven \u03b2 orientations in 15\u00b0 increments from the vertical (orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0) to the horizontal (orientation angle \u03b2=90\u00b0) direction. The minimum number of orientation angles tested should be three (orientation angles \u03b2=0\u00b0, 45 or 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0). Preferably, for each fine-grained rock formation, orientated, triaxially compressive strength tests should be conducted for at least four constant confining pressure \u03c33 magnitudes for each orientation angle \u03b2. The minimum number of confining pressures tested should be three. Therefore, preferably, each fine-grained rock formation in the database should have twenty-eight orientated triaxially compressive strength tests, and for a fine-grained rock formation to be included in the database, it should have a minimum of at least nine such associated tests. A schematic illustration of a database is shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is an exemplary illustration 600 of a fine-grained rock mechanical properties database used to develop predictive techniques for deriving shear strength anisotropy in subsurface formations. The depicted database includes eight generic rock types, each of which has a number of associated fine-grained rock formations: argillaceous and calcareous shales (39%) 601; laminated siltstones and mudstones (21%) 602; metamorphic slates (19%) 608; oil shales (5%) 603; artificial bilaminates (6%) 604; limestones (10%) 607; sandstones (10%) 606; and coals (10%) 605. The database may include thirty distinct fine-grained rock formations with a total of approximately nine-hundred discrete, orientated triaxial compression tests. Percentages refer to the number of core tests for each generic rock type relative to the total number of core tests in the database. As laboratory measurement of compressive failure strength is particularly difficult to accomplish successfully in fine-grained rocks due to their associated ultra-low permeabilities, proper methods should be used to quality control the experimental data before inclusion in the database. As one of the objectives is to predict rock strength anisotropy for wellbore stability applications associated with extended reach drilling through shale formations, 81% of all orientated triaxial compression tests in the illustrative database were conducted on fine-grained sedimentary rocks, of which 65% can be described as generic shales. The additional anisotropic sedimentary rock types and metamorphic slates are included for comparative purposes. In block 504 of the predictive workflow in FIG. 5, an automated surface fitting procedure is utilized to determine a common 3D anisotropic failure criterion for all database rocks. In the ideal embodiment, a 3D anisotropic failure criterion capable of defining all fine-grained rock formations in the database of core-measured strength values is derived as follows: (i) perform a series of orientated, triaxially compressive strength tests for seven \u03b2 orientations in 15\u00b0 increments from the vertical (\u03b2=0\u00b0) to the horizontal (\u03b2=90\u00b0) direction as in FIG. 2B. For each orientation angle, conduct at least four triaxial compression tests at different confining pressure \u03c33 magnitudes. (ii) perform a linear regression on measured \u03c31=f(\u03c33) data pairs for each orientation angle \u03b2 quantify unconfined compressive strength (UCS) (intercept) and triaxial stress factor k (slope) constants. FIG. 7 is a graph 700 of an exemplary analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating linear regression of each core-measured (e.g., \u03c31=f(\u03c33)) data pair for orientation angles \u03b2 to quantify unconfined compressive strength (UCS) (intercept) and triaxial stress factor k (slope) constants. In this graph 700, the core measurements and linear regression fits for the different orientation angles (as shown in the legend 701) are shown in relation to the confining pressure axis 702 in MPa and the compressive stress axis 704 in MPa. The various symbols (e.g., diamond for \u03b2=0\u00b0; circle for \u03b2=15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; triangle for \u03b2=45\u00b0) to 60\u00b0; square for \u03b2=75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) indicate the core measurements associated with the different orientation angles, while the different line types (e.g., solid line for \u03b2=0\u00b0; dash-dot line for \u03b2=15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; long dash for \u03b2=45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0; short dash for \u03b2=75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) indicate the linear regression fits for the different orientation angles. Also, the chart 706 represents the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and triaxial stress factor k (slope) constants for the graph 700. (iii) implement an automated 3D-surface fitting procedure to interpolate between these orientation-dependent linear fits with the constraint that the surface fit should have a common slope in the \u03c31 versus \u03c33 plane equal to the arithmetic mean of all core-derived k values. FIG. 8 is a graph 800 of an example analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating implementation of an automated 3D-surface fitting procedure to interpolate between core-derived 2D linear fits with the constraint that the surface fit should have a common slope in the \u03c31 versus \u03c33 plane equal to the arithmetic mean of all core-derived k values. In this graph 800, the 3D-surface fit 801 is shown for the different orientation angles along the orientation axis 802 relative to the confining pressure axis 806 in MPa and the compressive stress axis 804 in MPa. The various spherical symbols represent linear regression fits to core measurements as described in (ii) above. (iv) linear regression for pressure dependency of principal stresses \u03c31=f(\u03c33) at failure is then applied to the smoothed 3D surface fit for a given orientation angle \u03b2 in order to determine the equivalent UCS and k constants. FIG. 9 is a graph 900 of an exemplary analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating comparison of linear regression of smoothed 3D surface fit with core-measured \u03c31=f(\u03c33) data pairs. In comparison to the linear regressions depicted in FIG. 7, which have orientation dependent k values, the surfaced-derived regressions of FIG. 9 have the same k value for each orientation angle. In this graph 900, the core measurements and linear regression fits for the different orientation angles (as shown in the legend 901) are shown in relation to the confining pressure axis 902 in MPa and the compressive stress axis 904 in MPa. The various symbols (e.g., diamond for \u03b2=0\u00b0; circle for \u03b2=15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; triangle for \u03b2=45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0; square for \u03b2=75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) indicate the core measurements associated with the different orientation angles, while the different line types (e.g., solid line for \u03b2=0\u00b0; dash-dot line for \u03b2=15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; long dash for \u03b2=45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0; short dash for \u03b2=75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 indicate the linear regression fits to the 3D surface for the different orientation angles. (v) use UCS and k constants derived from linear regression of 2D core data and 3D surface data as described in (i) to (iv) above to determine cohesive strength \u03c40 versus orientation angle \u03b2 functions as shown in FIG. 10 using the transform in Equation (14): \u03c40=UCS/2\u221a{square root over (k)}\u2003\u2003Equation (14) (vi) use the method of least squares to fit a third order polynomial function to the 3D surface-derived \u03c40 versus \u03b2 curve as shown in FIG. 10, having the form: \u03c40(\u03b2)=A\u2032\u02c7\u03b2 3 +B\u2032\u02c7\u03b2 2 +C\u2032\u02c7\u03b2+\u03c4 0|\u03b2=0\u2003\u2003Equation (15) where \u03c40|\u03b2=0 represents the cohesive strength at \u03b2=0\u00b0 in which the direction of maximum loading is perpendicular to bedding and A\u2032, B\u2032 and C\u2032 are empirical constants. FIG. 10 is a graph 1000 of an exemplary analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating variation in core- and surface-derived cohesive strength \u03c40 with orientation angle \u03b2. In the depicted graph 1000, core-derived strength values (e.g., circles and dashed line 1006) correspond to the values generated from FIG. 7, whereas the surface-derived strength values (e.g., diamond and solid line 1008) correspond to the values generated from FIG. 9. In this graph 1000, the core-derived strength values and the surface-derived strength values are shown in relation to the orientation angle axis 1002 in degrees (\u00b0) and the cohesive strength axis 1004 in MPa. The diamond 1010 is the point where the surface-derived strength value is at a minimum. The circle 1012 is the point that represented the core measured cohesive strength value at an orientation angle of 0\u00b0. (vii) use k constants derived from linear regression of 2D core data and 3D surface data as described in (i) to (iv) above to determine internal friction angle \u03c6 versus orientation angle \u03b2 functions. FIG. 11 is a graph 1100 of an exemplary analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating variation in core- and surface-derived internal friction angle \u03c6 with orientation angle \u03b2. In this graph 1100, the core-derived values (e.g., circles and dashed line 1106) and the equivalent surface-derived mean internal friction angle value \u03c6 (e.g., solid line 1108) are shown in relation to the orientation angle axis 1102 in degrees (\u00b0) and the internal friction angle axis 1104 in degrees. Then, using the transform of Equation (16): tan \u03c6=(k\u22121)/(2\u221a{square root over (k)})\u2003\u2003Equation (16) A modified failure criterion for describing anisotropic strength in shear stress \u03c4 versus normal stress \u03c3n space, as derived from automated 3D surface fitting, therefore has the form in Equations (17), (18) and (19): \u03c4(\u03b2)=\u03c7\u02c7\u03c40|\u03b2=0+\u03c3n\u02c7tan \u03c6\u2003\u2003Equation (17) where: \u03c7=\u03c40(\u03b2)\u03c40|\u03b2=0 =A\u03b2 3 +B\u03b2 2 +C\u03b2+1\u2003\u2003Equation (18) and: \u03d5 _ = 1 N \ue89e \u2211 i = 1 N \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 i Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 19 ) The resultant anisotropic failure criterion as detailed in Equations (17), (18) and (19) therefore assigns all strength anisotropy to a systematic continuous variation in cohesive strength with orientation which is fit using a 3rd-order polynomial function. This polynomial VCS model can also be reproduced in principal stress space using Equation (20): \u03c3 1 \ue8a0 ( \u03b2 ) = [ 2 \ue89e \u03c4 0 \ue8a0 ( \u03b2 ) \ue89e cos \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 _ 1 - sin \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 _ ] + [ 1 + sin \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 _ 1 - sin \ue89e \ue89e \u03d5 _ ] \ue89e \u03c3 3 Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 20 ) Both core-derived and modeled (using Equation (20)) principal failure stresses are contrasted in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 is a graph of an exemplary analysis of one fine-grained database formation illustrating variation in core-derived and modeled (using anisotropic 3D failure criterion) peak strength \u03c31 values with orientation angle \u03b2 and confining pressure \u03c33. In this graph 1200, the core-derived strength values and the surface-derived strength values are shown in relation to the orientation angle axis 1202 in degrees (\u00b0) and the compressive stress axis 1204 in MPa and the confining pressure axis 1206 in MPa. The legend 1208 indicates the core-derived strength values (e.g., circles and dashed lines for the respective confining pressure) and the surface-derived strength values (e.g., solid line for the respective confining pressure). The anisotropic failure criterion of the present techniques has several distinct enhancements over the conventional approaches. The automated surface fitting procedure tends to minimize variability in measured strength not related to experimental variables (\u03c33 and \u03b2), but rather the result of between-sample material inhomogeneity. Further, the functional minimum in cohesive strength versus orientation at \u03b2min as shown in FIG. 10 is derived statistically. Moreover, only four empirical constants (A, B, C and \u03c6) are utilized to fully quantify shear strength anisotropy. In block 506, the database fine-grained rock formations are used to develop empirical relationships between the anisotropy parameters describing the 3D failure criterion for each formation and their equivalent bulk strength properties. In this manner, the bulk strength properties refer generally to those properties associated with trans-laminar failure in which failure occurs within the bulk material by cutting across the planes of weakness, and specifically to those properties describing bulk failure at \u03b2=0\u00b0 in which the direction of maximum applied compressive stress \u03c31 is coincident with the normal to the planar layering. This block 506 therefore utilizes the mechanical properties database to generate predictive algorithms that statistically relate the empirical constants A, B, C and \u03c6 describing the polynomial VCS anisotropic failure criterion, to the equivalent bulk strength properties \u03c30|\u03b2=0 and \u03c6|\u03b2=0. An example preferred embodiment for generating such predictive algorithms is detailed below, however, it is apparent that different specific mathematical functions may be used to the same effect. To quantify the magnitude of strength anisotropy, a cohesive strength reduction factor (CSR) representing the normalized strength difference associated with shearing across (trans-laminar) versus shear within (intra-laminar) the plane of anisotropy is calculated. FIG. 13 is a schematic representation 1300 of the cohesive strength reduction factor (CSR). In representation 1300, CSR is equal to the difference between trans-laminar cohesive strength at orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0 (as represented by block 1302) and intra-laminar cohesive strength at orientation angle \u03b2min (as represented by block 1304) divided by the trans-laminar cohesive strength at orientation angle \u03b2=0\u00b0 (as represented by block 1306). This factor may be represented by Equation (21): CSR = ( \u03c4 0 \ue89e \uf603 \u03b2 = 0 core \ue89e - \u03c4 0 \uf604 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \ue89e min model ) \u03c4 0 \ue89e \ue85c \u03b2 = 0 core = 1 - ( \u03c4 0 \ue89e \ue85c \u03b2 = \u03b2 \ue89e min model \u03c4 0 \ue89e \ue85c \u03b2 = 0 core ) Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 21 ) such that, as noted in Equation (22): \u03c40|\u03b2=\u03b2min model=\u03c40|\u03b2=0 core\u02c7(1\u2212CSR)\u2003\u2003Equation (22) For CSR as defined in Equation (21) trans-laminar strength can be derived from conventional triaxial compression testing (\u03b2=0\u00b0) with loading perpendicular to bedding) whereas intra-laminar strength is derived from the modeled functional minimum at \u03b2min as shown in FIG. 10 and associated with the automated 3D-surface fitting procedure. Intra-laminar and trans-laminar cohesive strengths are therefore simply related through CSR as given in Equation (22). CSR magnitude ranges from zero (implying trans-laminar equal to intra-laminar strength, the isotropic case) to unity (implying zero intra-laminar strength). FIG. 14 is a graph 1400 of an exemplary graphical technique for deriving CSR from bulk cohesion at \u03b2=0\u00b0 (\u03c40|\u03b2=0 either directly measured through conventional triaxial testing or predicted from geophysical wireline logs). In FIG. 14 CSR magnitude is plotted as a function of core-derived \u03c40|\u03b2=0 for all thirty database formations. In this graph 1400, the CSR values are shown in relation to the CSR axis 1402 (dimensionless) and the bulk cohesive strength axis 1404 in MPa. The legend 1406 indicates that shales are represented by circles, non-shales are represented by triangles and slates are represented by diamonds. The solid line 1408 represents a mean statistical fit to the observed CSR versus bulk cohesive strength data associated with planar sedimentary fabrics, the dotted line 1410 represents an upper bound to the statistical fit (e.g., +95% CL), and the dotted line 1412 represents a lower bound to the statistical fit (e.g., \u221295% CL). The dashed line 1414 represents an average CSR value associated with slaty cleavage, the line 1416 represents a maximum in the mean statistical fit associated with planar sedimentary fabrics, and the line 1418 represents the transition from the mean statistical fit to a constant average value for all planar sedimentary fabrics. It is apparent that the slates exhibit the greatest CSR values, presumably due to the crystallographic preferred orientation of their constituent platy minerals. However, all other lithologies with planar sedimentary fabrics exhibit a systematic trend that may be fit using an asymmetric peak function for \u03c40|\u03b2=0\u226645 MPa of the form of Equation (23): y = 4 \ue89e \u03b1 0 \ue89e \u03b1 1 \u03b1 2 + 1 \ue89e \u03b1 2 2 x \u03b1 2 + 1 \ue8a0 [ \u03b1 2 - 1 + ( \u03b1 1 / x ) \u03b1 2 \ue89e ( \u03b1 2 + 1 ) ] 2 Equation \ue89e \ue89e ( 23 ) where x=\u03c40|\u03b2=0, y=CSR and \u03b10, \u03b11 and \u03b12 are empirical constants. As \u03c40|\u03b2=0 can be derived from geophysical wireline logs using a variety of predictive techniques (e.g. Chang and Khaksar). FIG. 14 can therefore be used to estimate CSR in subsurface strata of interest without the requirement of orientated core testing. The asymmetric peak function in FIG. 14 exhibits a maximum CSR\u22480.65\u01050.10 at \u03c40|\u03b2=0 of approximately (\u2248) 15 MPa. The asymmetric peak function qualitatively delineates three distinct regions of strength anisotropy with increasing \u03c40|\u03b2=0 magnitude: weak, relatively isotropic fine-grained lithologies (termed Type I rocks); stronger, relatively anisotropic lithologies (termed Type II rocks); strong, relatively isotropic lithologies (termed Type III rocks). Empirical constants A, B and C describing the anisotropic cohesive strength polynomial function (Equation 18) can be determined from \u03c40|\u03b2=0 and CSR values using the Equation (24): A,B,C=\u03b1 3+\u03b14(\u03c40|\u03b2=0)+\u03b15(CSR)\u2003\u2003Equation (24) where \u03b13, \u03b14 and \u03b15 are A, B and C and lithology (Type I, II and III) dependent empirical constants pre-determined through multi-variate regression of the database lithologies. A nomograph (graphical representation of Equation (24)) is shown in FIG. 15 for deriving the appropriate magnitude of empirical constant A, for a given magnitude of \u03c40|\u03b2=0 and CSR. Constants B and C can be similarly derived. FIG. 15 is an exemplary nomogram for deriving empirical constant A from CSR and \u03c40|\u03b2=0. In this graph 1500, the CSR factors are shown in relation to the CSR factor axis 1502 (dimensionless) and the bulk cohesive strength axis 1504 in MPa. The graph 1500 also include various responses, which are referred to collectively as responses 1506, for fine-grained rocks exhibiting Type II anisotropy and various responses, which are referred to collectively as responses 1508, for fine-grained rocks exhibiting Type I and III anisotropy. For the database lithologies, the mean friction angle, \u03c6 exhibits a robust power law relationship with that measured from conventional triaxial compression testing (\u03b2=0\u00b0 with loading perpendicular to bedding) as shown in FIG. 16. FIG. 16 is a graph 1600 of an exemplary graphic of estimating mean friction angle \u03c6 from bulk friction angle at \u03b2=0\u00b0 (\u03c6|\u03b2=0) either directly measured through conventional triaxial testing or predicted from geophysical wireline logs). In this graph 1600, the estimated mean friction angles are shown in relation to the estimating mean friction angle axis 1602 in degrees and the measured bulk friction angle axis 1604 in degrees. The legend 1606 indicates that shales are represented by circles, non-shales are represented by triangles and slates are represented by diamonds. The solid line 1608 represents a mean statistical fit to the observed mean versus bulk friction angle data, the dotted line 1610 represents an upper bound to the statistical fit (e.g., +95% CL), and the dotted line 1612 represents a lower bound to the statistical fit (e.g., \u221295% CL). As \u03c6|\u03b2=0 can be derived from geophysical wireline logs using a variety of predictive techniques (e.g. Chang and Khaksar), FIG. 16 can therefore be used to estimate \u03c6 in subsurface strata of interest without the requirement of orientated core testing. In block 508, following development of empirical relationships between anisotropy parameters describing the selected 3D failure criterion and the equivalent bulk strength properties as detailed above, an additional step in the predictive workflow involves utilizing the well-known analysis of variance (ANOVA) collection of statistical tools to determine if the predictive algorithms so generated are statistically useful, that is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. Goodness of fit statistics can be used to quantify discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. For example, as a fit becomes better (e.g., as discrepancy between the observed and modeled values is lessened), the coefficient of determination approaches unity, the standard error decreases toward zero and the F-statistic tends towards infinity. If statistical analyses indicate a poor model fit to experimental observations, then the predictive workflow (as shown in FIG. 5) involves modifying the database of experimental observations. Statistical significance may be increased by increasing the number of fine-grained formations included in the database, or by further subdividing the spectrum of database rocks into generic lithotypes displaying common mechanical properties due to shared compositional and textural attributes. Separating database rocks with planar sedimentary fabrics from database rocks with metamorphic foliations as shown in FIG. 14 represents an example of this procedure. Also, lithotyping into Type I, II and III lithologies to enhance statistical significance, as shown in FIG. 15, further illustrates the advantages of this procedure. Alternatively (or in addition) to adjusting the database of core measurements as detailed above, the anisotropic failure criterion used to quantify orientation-dependent strength variation for all fine-grained rock formations can also be adjusted to increase statistical significance. For example, if ANOVA testing indicates that the predictive algorithms relating the polynomial VCS parameters A, B, C and \u03c6 to the equivalent bulk strength properties \u03c40|\u03b2=0 are \u03c6|\u03b2=0 not statistically significant, then a different anisotropic failure criterion can be fit to all fine-grained formation strength data to generate alternative predictive algorithms relating anisotropy parameters to bulk strength properties. For example, the weakness plane cohesive strength, \u03c40 w defined in Equation (1) for the discontinuous SPW model is positively correlated with bulk cohesive strength \u03c40|\u03b2=0 for all fine-grained database rocks with planar sedimentary fabrics. FIG. 17 is a graph 1700 of a method of estimating discontinuous single plane of weakness SPW cohesive strength \u03c40 w from bulk cohesion at \u03b2=0\u00b0 (\u03c40|\u03b2=0) either directly measured through conventional triaxial testing or predicted from geophysical wireline logs). In this graph 1700, the estimating discontinuous single plane of weakness SPW cohesive strength \u03c40 w are shown in relation to the estimating discontinuous SPW axis 1702 in MPa and the bulk cohesion axis 1704 in MPa. The legend 1706 indicates that shales are represented by circles and non-shales are represented by triangles. The solid line 1708 represents the mean statistical fit, the dotted line 1710 represents an upper bound to the statistical fit (e.g., +95% CL), and the dotted line 1712 represents a lower bound to the statistical fit (e.g., \u221295% CL). In addition, statistically significant correlations between equivalent material parameters from different failure criteria can also be developed for predictive purposes. For example, the weakness plane angle of internal friction \u03c6w defined in Equation (1) for the discontinuous SPW model is positively correlated with the mean friction angle, \u03c6 defined in Equation (19) for the polynomial VCS model, for all fine-grained database rocks with planar sedimentary fabrics. FIG. 18 is a graph 1800 of an estimating discontinuous single plane of weakness SPW angle of internal friction \u03c6w from continuous variable cohesive strength VCS mean friction angle \u03c6. In this graph 1800, the estimated discontinuous single plane of weakness SPW angles of internal friction \u03c6w are shown in relation to the estimated discontinuous SPW angle axis 1802 in degrees and the continuous variable cohesive strength VCS mean friction angle axis 1804 in degrees. The legend 1806 indicates that shales are represented by circles and non-shales are represented by triangles. The solid line 1808 represents the mean statistical fit, the dotted line 1810 represents the upper bound to the statistical fit (e.g., +95% CL), and the dotted line 1812 represents a lower bound to the statistical fit (e.g., \u221295% CL). In yet another embodiment it is evident that, if statistically significant correlations can be generated for predicting the material parameters of more than one anisotropic failure criteria, then these failure criteria can be combined to increase congruency with experimental data. For example, the strength predicted by the continuous VCS model can be combined with the strength predicted by the discontinuous SPW model, where the resultant strength is the lesser of that predicted by the two models. FIG. 19 are exemplary graphs 1900, 1920 and 1940 of combining two anisotropic failure criteria (continuous variable cohesive strength VCS and discontinuous single plane of weakness SPW models) to provide increased congruency with experimental data. Thus different failure criteria may be added together to provide an enhanced fit to the measured data.

        "Description": "Description This is a Divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/955,039 filed on Jul. 31, 2013 which is a divisional of Ser. No. 13/561,201 filed on Jul. 30, 2012 that is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/068,398, filed on May 10, 2011 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,541,855, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, and assigned to a common assignee. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a magnetic device that employs a thin film made of a Ni/Co laminate or the like with a magnetization direction which is perpendicular to the plane of the film (perpendicular magnetic anisotropy or PMA) wherein PMA is enhanced by an improved seed layer that induces a strong (111) crystal structure in the Ni/Co multilayer stack. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), based on the integration of silicon CMOS with magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) technology, is a major emerging technology that is highly competitive with existing semiconductor memories such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash. Similarly, spin-transfer (spin torque or STT) magnetization switching described by C. Slonczewski in \u0093Current driven excitation of magnetic multilayers\u0094, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. V 159, L1-L7 (1996), has stimulated considerable interest due to its potential application for spintronic devices such as spin-torque MRAM on a gigabit scale. Both MRAM and STT-MRAM may have a MTJ element based on a tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect wherein a stack of layers has a configuration in which two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer. The MTJ element is typically formed between a bottom electrode such as a first conductive line and a top electrode which is a second conductive line at locations where the top electrode crosses over the bottom electrode. A MTJ stack of layers may have a bottom spin valve configuration in which a seed layer, an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer, a ferromagnetic \u0093pinned\u0094 layer, a thin tunnel barrier layer, a ferromagnetic \u0093free\u0094 layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on a bottom electrode. The pinned or reference layer has a magnetic moment that is fixed in the \u0093y\u0094 direction, for example, by exchange coupling with the adjacent anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) layer that is also magnetized in the \u0093y\u0094 direction. The free layer has a magnetic moment that is either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic moment in the pinned layer. The tunnel barrier layer is thin enough that a current through it can be established by quantum mechanical tunneling of conduction electrons. The magnetic moment of the free layer may change in response to external magnetic fields and it is the relative orientation of the magnetic moments between the free and pinned layers that determines the tunneling current and therefore the resistance of the tunneling junction. When a sense current is passed from the top electrode to the bottom electrode in a direction perpendicular to the MTJ layers, a lower resistance is detected when the magnetization directions of the free and pinned layers are in a parallel state (\u00930\u0094 memory state) and a higher resistance is noted when they are in an anti-parallel state or \u00931\u0094 memory state. As the size of MRAM cells decreases, the use of external magnetic fields generated by current carrying lines to switch the magnetic moment direction becomes problematic. One of the keys to manufacturability of ultra-high density MRAMs is to provide a robust magnetic switching margin by eliminating the half-select disturb issue. For this reason, the spin torque MRAM was developed. Compared with conventional MRAM, spin-torque MRAM has an advantage in avoiding the half select problem and writing disturbance between adjacent cells. The spin-transfer effect arises from the spin dependent electron transport properties of ferromagnetic-spacer-ferromagnetic multilayers. When a spin-polarized current transverses a magnetic multilayer in a CPP configuration, the spin angular moment of electrons incident on a ferromagnetic layer interacts with magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic layer near the interface between the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic spacer. Through this interaction, the electrons transfer a portion of their angular momentum to the ferromagnetic layer. As a result, spin-polarized current can switch the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic layer if the current density is sufficiently high, and if the dimensions of the multilayer are small. The difference between a spin-torque MRAM and a conventional MRAM is only in the write operation mechanism. The read mechanism is the same. For MRAM and spin-torque MRAM applications, it is often important to take advantage of PMA films with a large and tunable coercivity field (Hc) and anisotropy field (Hk). For example, PMA films may be used as a pinned layer, free layer, or dipole (offset compensation) layer in a MTJ element or in PMA media used in magnetic sensors, magnetic data storage, and in other spintronic devices. Furthermore, a critical requirement is that Hc, Hk, and other properties such as the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio do not deteriorate during processing at elevated temperatures up to the 300\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. range. In some applications, it is also necessary to limit the overall thickness of the PMA layer and underlayers, and use only materials that are compatible with device design and processing requirements. Materials with PMA are of particular importance for magnetic and magnetic-optic recording applications. Spintronic devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have an advantage over MRAM devices based on in-plane anisotropy in that they can satisfy the thermal stability requirement and have a low switching current density but also have no limit of cell aspect ratio. As a result, spin valve structures based on PMA are capable of scaling for higher packing density which is one of the key challenges for future MRAM applications and other spintronic devices. When the size of a memory cell is reduced, much larger magnetic anisotropy is required because the thermal stability factor is proportional to the volume of the memory cell. Generally, PMA materials have magnetic anisotropy larger than that of conventional in-plane soft magnetic materials such as NiFe or CoFeB. Thus, magnetic devices with PMA are advantageous for achieving a low switching current and high thermal stability. Several PMA material systems have been proposed and utilized in the prior art such as multilayers of Pt/Fe, Pd/Co, and Ni/Co, and ordered (e.g., L10 structures) as well as unordered alloys but there is still a need for improvement in Hc, Hk, temperature stability, and material compatibility. There is a report by M. Nakayama et al. in \u0093Spin transfer switching in TbCoFe/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/TbCoFe magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\u0094, J. Appl. Phys. 103, 07A710 (2008) related to spin transfer switching in a MTJ employing a TbCoFe PMA structure. However, in a MTJ with a TbCoFe or FePt PMA layer, strenuous annealing conditions are usually required to achieve an acceptably high PMA value. Unfortunately, high temperatures are not so practical for device integration. Although (Co/Pt)x laminates are capable of generating high PMA, Co/Pt and similar multilayers including Co/Pd and Co/Ir and alloys thereof such as CoCrPt are not always desirable as a PMA layer in a MTJ element because Pt, Pd, Ir, and Cr are severe spin depolarizing materials and will seriously quench the amplitude of spintronic devices. Among the PMA material systems studied, a Ni/Co multilayer is one of the more promising candidates because of its large potential Hc and Hk, good stability at high anneal temperatures, and potential compatibility with other materials used in magnetic devices. However, Ni/Co multilayers typically require a thick seed layer to induce high PMA. A 500 Angstrom Ti or 500 Angstrom Cu seed layer with heating to 150\u00b0 C. is used by P. Bloemen et al. in \u0093Magnetic anisotropies in Co/Ni (111) multilayers\u0094, J. Appl. Phys. 72, 4840 (1992). W. Chen et al. in \u0093Spin-torque driven ferromagnetic resonance of Co/Ni synthetic layers in spin valves\u0094, Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 012507 (2008) describe a 1000 Angstrom Cu/200 Angstrom Pt/100 Angstrom Cu composite seed layer. The aforementioned seed layers are not practical with Ni/Co multilayer PMA configurations in spintronic devices. Typically, there is a space restriction in a direction perpendicular to the planes of the spin valve layers in advanced devices in order to optimize performance. Seed layers thicker than about 100 Angstroms will require thinning a different layer in the spin valve structure to maintain a certain minimum thickness for the MTJ element which can easily lead to performance degradation. A [(Co/Ni)20] laminated structure with a thin Ta/Ru/Cu seed layer is disclosed as a hard bias layer in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2010/0330395 and as a reference layer in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0257151. However, even higher Hc is desirable to be competitive with Hc values obtained with Pt/Co and Pd/Co laminates. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,843,669, a fcc (111) crystal orientation is described as desirable for a pinned layer or free layer but a Ni/Co laminate with (111) orientation is not disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 7,190,613 describes a fixed layer having a high coercive force and made of ordered alloys such as FePt, CoPt, and FePd, or disordered alloys including Co/Cr, Co/Pt, Co/Cr/Pt and the like. For ordered alloys with a fct (001) orientation, an underlayer such as MgO, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Al or Cr with a similar crystal structure is preferred. An improved seed layer is still needed that is thin enough to be compatible with spintronic devices, can induce high PMA in overlying Co/Ni multilayer structures, and is compatible with the design and processing requirements of magnetic devices. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One objective of the present invention is to provide a seed layer/PMA layer configuration for a magnetic device that has higher Hk and Hc than previously realized and with thermal stability up to 400\u00b0 C. process temperatures. A second objective of the present invention is to provide a material set for a high PMA structure according to the first objective that is compatible with other layers in the magnetic device and has a seed layer thickness of about 100 Angstroms or less. According to one embodiment, these objectives are achieved with a magnetic element that is a MTJ having a bottom spin valve configuration in which a seed layer, PMA reference layer, tunnel barrier, free layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The seed layer (underlayer) is preferably NiCr, NiFeCr, Hf, or a composite with a Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf configuration that induces a strong (111) texture in the overlying Co/Ni multilayer stack within the reference layer. In an alternative embodiment, Ni in the Co/Ni multilayer is replaced by X to give a Co/X multilayer stack within the reference layer where X is one of V, Rh, Ir, Os, Ru, Au, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ti, Re, Si, and Mg. Preferably, the reference layer has a [(Co/Ni)n/CoFeB] or [Co/X)n/CoFeB] configuration where n is from 2 to 30 and the CoFeB (or CoFe) layer serves as a transitional layer between the (111) crystalline structure of the Co/Ni or Co/X multilayer stack and the (100) texture of a MgO tunnel barrier. The transitional layer preferably has PMA and a magnetization aligned in the same direction as the PMA layer. The free layer may be comprised of CoFeB, CoFe, or a combination thereof. Thus, a high MR ratio is achieved together with high PMA in the reference layer to enable greater thermal stability in the magnetic element. In a second embodiment, the MTJ has a top spin valve structure wherein a seed layer, PMA free layer, tunnel barrier, reference layer, and capping layer are sequentially formed on a substrate. The PMA free layer may be a composite with a Co/Ni or Co/X laminate formed on the seed layer and an upper magnetic layer contacting the tunnel barrier. Again, the magnetic layer may be CoFeB and serve as a transitional layer between a (100) MgO tunnel barrier and a Co/Ni multilayer with a (111) texture. Both of the first and second embodiments may further comprise a Ta insertion layer between the Co/Ni or Co/X multilayer and the transitional layer to prevent premature crystallization of the transitional layer before the tunnel barrier is fabricated. In a third embodiment, a dipole layer with an underlayer/PMA layer configuration as defined in the first embodiment is used to provide an offset field to an adjacent free layer. The MTJ has a stack represented by seed layer/reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer/spacer/dipole layer/capping layer. The spacer may be a non-magnetic Ta layer to getter oxygen from the free layer. Once all the layers in the MTJ stack are laid down, a high temperature annealing of about 350\u00b0 C. may be employed to increase the PMA within the Co/Ni laminated portion of the reference layer, free layer, or dipole layer. Alternatively, the (Co/Ni)n multilayer in the previous embodiments may be replaced by a CoFe/Ni, Co/NiFe, Co/NiCo, CoFe/NiFe, or a CoFe/NiCo laminated structure, by pure Co, or may be one of Co/Pt, Co/Pd, Fe/Pt, Fe/Pd, or Fe/N. In yet another embodiment, the (Co/X) stack described previously may be replaced by a disordered alloy that is one of CoV, CoRh, CoIr, CoOs, CoRu, CoAu, CoCr, CoMo, CoCu, CoTi, CoRe, CoMg, or CoSi to give a (CoX)n laminated PMA layer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a composite structure with a seed layer/PMA layer configuration in a magnetic element wherein the seed layer induces a strong (111) crystalline structure in an overlying (Ni/Co)n, (Co/X)n or (CoX)n multilayer where X is one of V, Rh, Ir, Os, Ru, Au, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ti, Re, Mg, or Si thereby generating high PMA in the laminated stack. Note that \u0093seed layer\u0094 may be used interchangeably with the term \u0093underlayer\u0094 in the exemplary embodiments, and (Ni/Co)n and (Co/Ni)n, for example, are used interchangeably when referring to a laminated stack. Although only bottom and top spin valve structures are depicted in the drawings, the present invention also encompasses dual spin valves having an enhanced PMA layer that is incorporated in one or more of a reference layer, free layer, dipole layer, or pinned layer in MRAM, spin-torque-MRAM, domain wall motion devices, and in other spintronic devices. Furthermore, the PMA structure may be used as a medium in magnetic sensors or in magnetic data storage applications. A key feature of the present invention is a (Co/Ni)n or (Co/X)n multilayer structure having PMA where the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the aforementioned laminate arises from spin-orbit interactions of the 3d and 4s electrons of Co and Ni (or Co and X) atoms. Such interaction causes the existence of an orbital moment which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal axes which are in (111) alignment, and also leads to an alignment of the spin moment with the orbital moment. PMA character is enhanced by the presence of an appropriate seed layer (underlayer) also having a (111) texture. Ideally, the seed layer has a composition which is compatible with other materials in a magnetic element that contains the (Co/Ni)n or (Co/X)n laminate, is compatible with processing temperatures up to about 400\u00b0 C., and is thin enough so as not to adversely affect the performance of the magnetic element. Referring to FIG. 1, a seed layer/PMA multilayer configuration is shown as part of a MTJ 20 with a bottom spin valve structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Each of the layers in the MTJ are formed in an (x, y) plane and each have a thickness in a z-axis direction. A substrate 21 is provided that may be a bottom electrode layer, for example, made of Ta or other conductive layers. Substrate 21 may be formed on a substructure (not shown) that includes dielectric and conductive layers as well as transistors and other devices. A key feature is the seed layer 22 formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 22 has a thickness from 10 to 300 Angstroms, and preferably 10 to 100 Angstroms. According to one embodiment, the seed layer is NiCr, NiFeCr, or Hf. For a NiCr or NiFeCr seed layer, Cr content is between 35 and 45 atomic % Cr, and preferably is 40 atomic % Cr. Alternatively, seed layer 22 may be a composite with a Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf composition wherein the NiCr or NiFeCr layer has a greater thickness than the Hf layer. As a result of the preferred seed layer composition, a (111) texture is induced and fully established in a (Co/NOn multilayer or the like grown on a top surface of the seed layer. Top surface in this context is a surface facing away from substrate 21. Above the seed layer 22 is a composite reference layer 30 that according to one embodiment has a (Co/NOn/CoFeB, a (Co/X)n/CoFeB, or (CoX)n/CoFeB configuration wherein a lower PMA layer 23 has a (Co/Ni)n, (Co/X)n, or (CoX)n composition in which n is from 2 to 30, and preferably between 4 and 10, and CoX is a disordered alloy. PMA layer 23 contacts the seed layer while a magnetic layer 24 made of CoFeB, CoFe, or a combination thereof is formed as an interface between the PMA layer and the tunnel barrier 25. Each of the plurality of Co layers in the PMA layer has a thickness from 1.5 to 4 Angstroms, and each of the plurality of Ni, X, or CoX layers has a thickness from 4 to 10 Angstroms. In yet another embodiment, PMA layer 23 may be pure Co. In another embodiment, the lower PMA layer 23 may be comprised of two metals, a metal and an alloy, or two alloys having an (A1/A2)n configuration where A1 is a first metal or alloy selected from one or more of Co, Ni, and Fe that may be doped with B up to 50 atomic %, A2 is a second metal or alloy selected from one or more of Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, and Pd, n is the number of laminates in the (A1/A2)n stack, and A1 is unequal to A2. It should be understood that the laminated (A1/A2)n stack has intrinsic PMA and the seed layer 22 is employed to enhance the PMA property. Thus, the PMA layer 23 may be comprised of (CoFe/Ni)n, Co/NiFe)n, (Co/NiCo)n, (CoFe/NiFe)n, or (CoFe/NiCo)n laminates, for example. Alternatively, the PMA layer may have a (Co/Pt)n, Co/Pd)n, (Fe/Pt)n, (Fe/Pd)n, or (Fe/V)n composition, or a combination of the aforementioned laminates. In another embodiment, A2 is a second metal or alloy selected from one or more of X, FeX, and CoX. In this case, the PMA layer 23 may be comprised of (CoFe/X)n, Co/FeX)n, (Co/CoX)n, (CoFe/FeX)n, or (CoFe/CoX)n laminates. In yet another embodiment, the lower PMA layer 23 may be comprised of two individual magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer (C) providing anti-ferromagnetic (RKKY) coupling between the two magnetic layers as in an A1/C/A2 configuration. In this embodiment, the non-magnetic spacer is preferably Ru with a thickness of 3 to 20 angstroms. The present invention also encompasses an embodiment wherein the lower PMA layer 23 may be an alloy with a L10 structure of the form MT wherein M is Rh, Pd, Pt, Ir, or an alloy thereof, and T is Fe, Co, Ni or alloy thereof. Furthermore, the MT alloy may be doped with B up to 40 atomic %. Preferably, the magnetic layer 24 has a thickness from about 6 to 14 Angstroms which is sufficiently thin to enable interfacial perpendicular anisotropy to dominate the in-plane shape anisotropy field and thereby generate PMA character therein. According to one embodiment, PMA within magnetic layer 24 is achieved as a result of the interface between a thin CoFeB (or CoFe) layer and a metal oxide layer in tunnel barrier 25 that leads to a significant amount of interfacial perpendicular anisotropy, and the magnetic moments of layers 23, 24 are aligned in the same direction along the z-axis. The magnetic layer serves as a transitional layer between the (111) texture in PMA layer 23 and a (100) texture in tunnel barrier 25 and may also enhance the magnetoresistive (MR) ratio. As the magnetic layer thickness becomes closer to 6 Angstroms, PMA character is maximized, and as layer 24 thickness approaches 14 Angstroms, MR ratio is increased. Therefore, the thickness of the magnetic layer may be adjusted between 6 and 14 Angstroms to tune both PMA magnitude and MR ratio. There is a tunnel barrier layer 25 preferably made of MgO formed on the composite reference layer 30. However, other tunnel barrier materials such as AlOx, TiOx, and ZnOx may be employed. A MgO tunnel barrier layer may be fabricated by depositing a first Mg layer on the magnetic layer 24, then performing a natural oxidation (NOX) process, and finally depositing a second Mg layer on the oxidized first Mg layer. During a subsequent annealing process, the second Mg layer is oxidized to afford a substantially uniform MgO layer. If a low RA (resistance\u00d7area) value is desired, the thickness and/or oxidation state of the tunnel barrier 25 may be reduced as appreciated by those skilled in the art. A free layer 26 is formed on the tunnel barrier layer 25 and may be a composite and comprised of the same composition as in magnetic layer 24. Preferably, CoFeB, CoFe, or other materials which produce a combination of high MR ratio, good switching property, and low magnetostriction are selected as the free layer. The uppermost layer in the spin valve stack is a capping layer 27. In one aspect, the capping layer is a composite with a lower layer 27 a made of Ta and an upper layer 27 b that is Ru which is used to provide oxidation resistance and excellent electrical contact to an overlying top electrode (not shown). A substantial reduction in critical current density (Jc) occurs in STT-MRAM applications when a thin Ru layer is employed as a capping layer due to the strong spin scattering effect of Ru. The Ta layer may be included to offer etch resistance in subsequent processing steps. Optionally, other capping layer configurations may be employed. For example, the capping layer 27 may be a single layer of Ta or Ru, a composite with a Ru/Ta/Ru configuration, or a composite with a lower oxide or nitride layer and an upper Ru layer such as MgO/Ru or AlOx/Ru. An oxide as the lower layer in the capping layer may be advantageously used to promote PMA in a thin free layer 26. Referring to FIG. 2, the composite reference layer 30 of the first embodiment is modified to include a Ta insertion layer 35 about 0.5 to 3 Angstroms thick, and preferably 1.5 Angstroms thick, sandwiched between the PMA layer and an amorphous CoFeB magnetic layer 24 to prevent crystallization of the CoFeB layer before a MgO tunnel barrier 25 is formed thereon. As a result, crystallization of an amorphous CoFeB layer during a subsequent annealing step is driven by the (100) MgO tunnel barrier and a major portion (not shown) of the magnetic layer crystallizes in a (100) state to maximize the MR ratio in the MTJ. It should be understood that a thin region (not shown) of a CoFeB magnetic layer 24 which adjoins the PMA layer 23 will have a (111) crystal structure or remains amorphous but the thickness of this thin region may be minimized by including the Ta insertion layer 35. Referring to FIG. 3, a second embodiment is depicted that shows a MTJ 40 wherein the seed layer/PMA layer configuration of the present invention is incorporated in a composite free layer. In other words, the seed layer/PMA layer configuration as defined herein is not limited to a reference (pinned) layer but may be used as any functional or passive layer in a magnetic stack. Preferably, the MTJ in this embodiment has a top spin valve structure in which a seed layer, composite free layer, tunnel barrier, reference layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 22 and PMA layer 23 are retained from the first embodiment but in this case the laminated PMA layer is included in a composite free layer. Reference layer 29 formed on the tunnel barrier is comprised of CoFeB, CoFe, or combinations thereof and may have a well known synthetic anti-parallel (SyAP) configuration (not shown) wherein two ferromagnetic layers such as CoFeB are separated by a coupling layer which is Ru, for example. Tunnel barrier 25 and capping layer 27 are retained from the first embodiment. Preferably, the tunnel barrier is MgO to maximize the MR ratio in the MTJ 40. Furthermore, the composite free layer 31 may have a seed layer 22/PMA layer 23/magnetic layer 24 configuration where the magnetic layer serves as a transitional layer between the (100) texture in the tunnel barrier layer and the (111) crystal structure in PMA layer 23 to promote a high MR ratio. Preferably, the magnetic layer 24 is made of CoFeB with a thickness of about 6 to 14 Angstroms so that interfacial perpendicular anisotropy dominates shape anisotropy within the layer to result in PMA with a magnetization direction that is aligned in the same z-axis direction as in PMA layer 23. The composite free layer 31 may further include a Ta insertion layer (not shown) formed between PMA layer 23 and magnetic layer 24. Seed layer (underlayer) 22 is preferably one of NiCr, NiFeCr, Hf, Hf/NiCr, Hf/NiFeCr, NiFeCr/Hf, or NiCr/Hf with a 5 to 200 Angstrom thickness to enhance the PMA character in PMA layer 23 thereby increasing thermal stability without compromising other free layer properties. Referring to FIG. 4, a third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and depicts a MTJ 50 having a bottom spin valve structure wherein the seed layer/PMA layer of the present invention is employed as a dipole layer to reduce the offset of the minor switching loop of the free layer caused by a dipole field from the reference layer. According to one embodiment, a seed layer, reference layer, tunnel barrier, free layer, spacer, dipole layer, and a capping layer are sequentially formed on substrate 21. The seed layer 28 may be NiCr or NiFeCr. Reference layer 29 and tunnel barrier layer 25 are retained from the second embodiment. Preferably, the reference layer is thin with a thickness from 5 to 15 Angstroms. Free layer 26 and capping layer 27 were previously described with regard to the first embodiment. In one aspect, a CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer may be employed to provide a high MR ratio. A key feature is the stack of layers formed between the free layer and capping layer. In particular, a non-magnetic spacer 33 made of Ta, for example, contacts a top surface of free layer 26 and getters oxygen from the free layer. Above the spacer is a composite dipole layer 34 including an underlayer 22 that contacts a top surface of the spacer and a PMA layer 23 that interfaces with capping layer 27. Layers 22, 23 retain the same features as described with respect to the first two embodiments except the underlayer is preferably 5 to 100 Angstroms thick in this embodiment. In one aspect, free layer 26 may be sufficiently thin (6 to 15 Angstroms) to have significant interfacial perpendicular anisotropy that dominates an in-plane shape anisotropy field such that a magnetization perpendicular to the plane of the free layer is established. Interfacial perpendicular anisotropy is a result of the interface between a bottom surface of free layer 26 and a top surface of tunnel barrier 25 which is preferably MgO. When the free layer has PMA, the magnetization directions of the free layer and PMA layer 23 are preferably aligned in the same direction. All of the layers in the MTJ elements described herein may be formed in a sputter deposition system such as an Anelva C-7100 thin film sputtering system or the like which typically includes three physical vapor deposition (PVD) chambers each having 5 targets, an oxidation chamber, and a sputter etching chamber. At least one of the PVD chambers is capable of co-sputtering. Typically, the sputter deposition process involves an argon sputter gas with ultra-high vacuum and the targets are made of metal or alloys to be deposited on a substrate. All of the MTJ layers may be formed after a single pump down of the sputter system to enhance throughput. The present invention also encompasses an annealing step after all layers in the spin valve structure have been deposited. The MTJ elements 20, 40, 50 may be annealed by applying a temperature between 300\u00b0 C. and 400\u00b0 C. for a period of 30 minutes to 5 hours using a conventional oven, or for only a few seconds when a rapid thermal anneal oven is employed. No applied magnetic field is necessary during the annealing step because PMA is established in layer 23 due to the seed layer 22 and because of the Co\u0097Ni (or A1-A2) spin orbital interactions in the laminated PMA layer 23. Once all the layers in MTJ elements 20, 40, or 50 are formed, the spin valve stack is patterned into an oval, circular, or other shapes from a top-down perspective along the z-axis by a well known photoresist patterning and reactive ion etch transfer sequence. Thereafter, an insulation layer (not shown) may be deposited on the substrate 21 followed by a planarization step to make the insulation layer coplanar with the capping layer 27. Next, a top electrode (not shown) may be formed on the capping layer. Referring to FIG. 5, an embodiment is depicted wherein the MTJ of the first embodiment is fabricated in a domain wall motion device. In one aspect, composite reference layer 30 is formed in a MTJ stack having a seed layer/reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer/capping layer configuration. A key feature is that seed layer 22 and reference layer 30 have a width along an in-plane x-axis direction that is substantially less than the width of the overlying stack of layers. In fact, the stack of layers including tunnel barrier 25, free layer 26, and capping layer 27 may be patterned to provide a wire which from a top-down view (not shown) is part of an array of wires that are employed for storage of digital information. Another important feature is that free layer 26 has a plurality of domain walls (75 a-75 d) each extending vertically from a top surface that interfaces with layer 27 a to a bottom surface which interfaces with tunnel barrier layer 25. There is a magnetic domain bounded by each pair of domain walls within the composite free layer. The number of domain walls is variable but is selected as four in the exemplary embodiment for illustrative purposes. In particular, the magnetic domain 92 aligned in a z-axis direction above reference layer 30 has a switchable magnetization that changes from a (+) z-direction to a (\u2212) z-direction or vice versa when a switching current is applied during a write process. Note that free layer has two ends 37 e, 37 f connected to a current/voltage source 81 in a first electrical loop including wiring 85 a to a junction 82 to wire 83 and to end 37 e, and a wire 84 attached to end 37 f to enable a write process. Furthermore, there is a second electrical loop which allows a readout of digital information in the switchable magnetic domain 92 during a read process. Thus, current can be sent from source 81 through wires 85 a, 85 b and to readout 80 and then to wire 86 and through reference layer 30, tunnel barrier 25, and free layer 26 before exiting end 37 f and returning to the source to complete a circuit. In so doing, the readout device 80 is able to recognize whether the switchable magnetic domain 92 has a magnetization in a (+) z-axis direction 90 b or in a (\u2212) z-axis direction 90 a. Example 1 An experiment was performed to demonstrate the advantage of a seed layer in improving PMA in an overlying (Co/Ni)n multilayer stack according to the present invention. A partial and unpatterned spin valve stack comprised of a seed layer, a (Co/Ni)10 laminated layer where each Co layer is 2.5 Angstroms thick and each Ni layer is 6 Angstroms thick, and a Ru cap layer was fabricated in order to obtain PMA values from M-H curves using a vibrating sample magnometer (VSM). All samples were annealed at 350\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. In FIG. 6 a, less than ideal seed layers such as TaN, PtMn, NiFe, and Ru were employed. In FIG. 6 b, 100 Angstrom thick NiCr and Hf seed layers were formed according to the present invention to provide improved performance including squarer M-H loops and higher coercivity (higher PMA) as depicted in curves 41, 42, respectively, compared with the films grown on the inadequate seed layers in FIG. 6 a. Note that a greater distance between the vertical sections of each pair of curves in FIG. 6 b means a higher PMA is achieved. Thus, a NiCr seed layer leads to higher PMA than a Hf seed layer of similar thickness. Referring to FIGS. 7 a-7 b, additional partial spin valve stacks were prepared by sequentially forming a composite seed layer, (Co/Ni)10 laminated layer, and Ru capping layer. Coercivity in an in-plane direction with respect to the film plane is illustrated in FIG. 7 b for a Hf20/NiCr100 seed layer configuration (curve 53) and for a NiCr100/Hf20 seed layer configuration (curve 54). Magnetization or PMA in a perpendicular-to-plane direction is represented for the Hf/NiCr and NiCr/Hf configurations in curves 51, 52, respectively in FIG. 7 a. The resulting laminated films grown on composite seed layers of the present invention show high coercivity and good squareness. Related measurements on single layer seed films show a high saturation field (perpendicular anisotropy) of about 4000 Oe for a Hf underlayer and around 10000 Oe for a NiCr underlayer. Note that in a composite seed layer such as Hf/NiCr, the upper layer which contacts the Co/Ni (or A1-A2) laminate has a larger effect in enhancing PMA in the multilayer than the lower layer contacting the substrate. Since a NiCr underlayer generates a higher PMA than a Hf underlayer (10000 Oe vs. 4000 Oe) as indicated previously, a Hf/NiCr seed layer (curve 51) leads to a higher PMA than a NiCr/Hf seed layer (curve 52) Example 2 To further demonstrate the benefits of the present invention according to a first embodiment where the composite seed layer/laminated PMA layer is formed as a reference layer in a MTJ suitable for spin-torque MRAM devices, a MTJ stack was fabricated as represented in the following stack of layers where the number following each layer is the thickness in Angstroms: Si/SiO2/Ta50/Hf20/NiCr100/(Co2.5/Ni6)10/Co20Fe60B206/MgO/Co20Fe60B2012/Ta20/Ru. In the aforementioned structure, Si/SiO2 is the substrate, Ta is a bottom electrode, Hf/NiCr is a composite seed layer, (Co/Ni)10 is the laminated PMA portion of the reference layer, CoFeB is the transitional magnetic layer adjoining a MgO tunnel barrier, CoFeB is the free layer, and Ta/Ru is the capping layer. Thus, (Co/Ni)10/Co20Fe50B20 serves as a composite reference layer to provide a high MR ratio wherein the CoFeB portion is thin enough to preserve the PMA property and thick enough to generate a high MR ratio because of cohesive tunneling in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB stack of layers. In addition to promoting a high magneto-resistive ratio, the CoFeB free layer is selected for switching purposes. An anneal process comprising a 300\u00b0 C. temperature treatment for 1 hour was used for this experiment. Referring to FIG. 8, a M-H loop measurement is illustrated for the MTJ stack described above and shows significant PMA as a result of the composite reference layer structure, and an additional PMA contribution from the CoFeB free layer. The steps 61 a, 61 b in the M-H loop indicate the reference layer and free layer switch independently with the reference layer having a much greater coercivity compared with the free layer as revealed by the greater height for step 61 b related to the reference layer. Therefore, the reference layer may serve as a \u0093pinned layer\u0094. Example 3 According to a third embodiment of the present invention, the composite seed layer/laminated PMA layer as described previously may be incorporated as a dipole layer in a MTJ represented in the following stack of layers: Si/SiO2/Ta50/NiCr100/Co20Fe60B203/MgO/Co20Fe50B2012/Ta10/NiCr20/(Cu2.5/Ni6)10/Ru. In the aforementioned structure, Si/SiO2 is the substrate, Ta50 is a 50 Angstrom thick bottom electrode, NiCr100 is a 100 Angstrom thick seed layer, CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB is a reference layer/tunnel barrier/free layer configuration, and Ta10 is non-magnetic spacer with a 10 Angstrom thickness between the free layer and a 20 Angstrom thick NiCr underlayer for the laminated PMA structure which is (Co/Ni)10. Ru is a capping layer. Referring to FIG. 9, a M-H loop measurement is depicted that shows magnetization in a direction perpendicular to the film plane of the layers in the aforementioned MTJ stack having a dipole layer. In this case, the dipole layer and free layer both have PMA and switch at different fields allowing the two layers to be set in the desired configuration. Step 71 b for the dipole layer is substantially greater than the step 71 a for the free layer. There is no PMA contribution observed for the reference layer which is purposely kept very thin at 3 Angstroms for this experiment. In a functional MTJ, reference layer thickness is generally maintained between 5 and 15 Angstroms and would exhibit substantial PMA. By reducing the thickness of the Ta spacer between the dipole layer and the free layer, the dipole layer is allowed to provide more offset field to the free layer. Moreover, the thickness of the NiCr underlayer adjoining the Co/Ni laminate may be adjusted to amplify or reduce the offset field applied to the free layer. The MTJ elements described herein feature a seed layer/PMA laminated layer combination which offers enhanced PMA properties together with improved compatibility with high temperature processing, and improved compatibility with the design and fabrication of magnetic devices. As a result, the embodiments of the present invention are suitable for a variety of applications including advanced PMA spin-torque MRAM devices, domain wall motion devices, and in-plane magnetic devices wherein it is beneficial to introduce an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy component as in in-plane spin torque MRAM devices or in partial PMA spin torque MRAM devices. Improved PMA properties include increased Hc and Hk that enable higher thermal stability up to 400\u00b0 C. processing. While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to, the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.",

BACKGROUND Conductive nanostructures, owing to their submicron dimensions, are capable of forming thin conductive films. Often the thin conductive films are optically transparent, also referred to as \"transparent conductors.\" Copending and co-owned U.S. Patent Application Nos. 1 1/504,822, 1 1/871 ,767, and 1 1/871 ,721 describe transparent conductors formed by interconnecting anisotropic conductive nanostructures such as metal nano wires. Nanostructure-based transparent conductors are particularly useful as transparent electrodes such as those coupled to thin film transistors in electrochromic displays, including flat panel displays and touch screens. In addition, nanostructure-based transparent conductors are also suitable as coatings on color filters and polarizers, and so forth. The above co-pending applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. To prepare a conductive film or a nanostructure network layer, a liquid dispersion of the nanostructures can be deposited on a substrate, followed by a drying or curing process. The liquid dispersion is also referred to as an \"ink composition\" or \"ink formulation.\" The ink composition typically comprises nanostructures (e.g., metal nanowires) and a liquid carrier (or dispersant). Optional agents, such as a binder, a viscosity modifier, and/or surfactants, may also be present to facilitate dispersion of the nanostructures and/or immobilization of the nanostructures on the substrate. A thin film of a nanostructure network layer is formed following the ink deposition and after the dispersant is at least partially dried or evaporated. The nanostructure network layer thus comprises nanostructures that are randomly distributed and interconnect with one another and with the other non- volatile components of the ink composition, including, for example, the binder, viscosity modifier and surfactant. As disclosed in co-owned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/504,822 cited above, roll-to-roll web coating is compatible with such solution-based deposition (coating) processes for transparent conductor fabrication. In particular, web-coating produces substantially uniform and reproducible conductive films on flexible substrates (\"web\"). Suitable roll-to-roll deposition processes can include, but are not limited to, slot die, gravure, reverse gravure, micro-gravure, reverse roll and Mayer-bar. There is a need to further enhance the uniformity and reproducibility of conductive films. BRIEF SUMMARY One embodiment provides a method of forming a conductive film, the method comprising: providing a coating solution having a plurality of conductive nanostructures and a fluid carrier; moving a web in a machine direction; forming a wet film by depositing the coating solution on the moving web, wherein the wet film has a first dimension extending parallel to the machine direction and a second dimension transverse to the machine direction; applying an air flow across the wet film along the second dimension, whereby at least some of the conductive nanostructures in the wet film are reoriented; and allowing the wet film to dry to provide the conductive film. Another embodiment provides a conductive film formed according to the above method, where, when a first sheet resistance along the first dimension (RMD) and a second sheet resistance along the second dimension (RTD) are measured at a given location on the conductive film, a ratio (RTD /RMD) of the second sheet resistance and the first sheet resistance defines an anisotropy of the sheet resistances, and wherein the anisotropy is less than 2, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2. Yet another embodiment provides a conductive film, wherein anisotropies are measured at a plurality of locations across the second dimension to provide a maximum anisotropy and a minimum anisotropy, and wherein the difference between the maximum anisotropy and the minimum anisotropy is less than 25%, less than 20%, or less than 15%, or less than 10%, or less than 5% of the minimum anisotropy. A further embodiment provides a method of forming a conductive film, the method comprising: forming a wet film having a plurality of conductive nanostructures and a fluid carrier, wherein the wet film has a first dimension and a second dimension transverse to the first dimension; and applying an air flow across the wet film along the second dimension, whereby at least some of the conductive nanostructures in the wet film are reoriented. Yet another embodiment provides a conductive film comprising a plurality of conductive nanostructures, wherein a first dimension of the conductive film is perpendicular to a second dimension of the conductive film and a first sheet resistance (RMD) along the first dimension and a second sheet resistance (RTD) along the second dimension are measured at a given location on the conductive film, and wherein a ratio (RTD /RMD) of the second sheet resistance and the first sheet resistance defines an anisotropy of the sheet resistances, wherein the anisotropy is less than 2, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2.. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows the basic concept of cross-web air flow to reduce anisotropy of sheet resistance. Figure 2 demonstrates the anisotropy reduction as a function of the position (Sample A was fabricated using the cross-web air flow, Sample B is a control sample fabricated without the cross-web air flow) Figures 3A and 3B show micrographs of nanowires deposited without cross-web air flow (A) and with cross-web air flow (B). Figure 4 is a schematic implementation of the cross-web air flow an air duct as a channeling device. Figure 5 is a side view of an air duct that provides a substantially uniform amount of air flow across the entire width of the wet film. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In roll-to-roll coating processes, the direction in which the coated substrate travels is referred to herein as the machine direction (\"MD\"). The direction transverse (i.e., at a right angle) to the MD is referred to as the cross-web or transverse direction (\"TD\"). During the roll-to-roll deposition of an ink composition of nanowires, it has been observed that the deposited nanowires may show increased tendency to align in the machine direction when compared to the transverse direction. Such variation in alignment may lead to a longer range of connectivity of nanowires in the machine direction as compared to that in the transverse direction. This can give rise to an anisotropy in transparent conductor sheet resistance wherein such sheet resistance is lower in the machine direction (RMD) than it is in the transverse direction (RTD). Provided herein is a post-deposition treatment to decrease the difference between RMD and RTD by applying a cross-web air flow immediately after the deposition of the nanowires solution. It is believed that the anisotropy observed in nanowire alignment is caused by preferential alignment of the nanowires due to shear in the coating bead or in the slot die during the coating process. Rather than addressing this anisotropy during the deposition itself, reduction of the nanowires' preferential alignment in MD can be achieved after the deposition of the wet film and when the film is still sufficiently fluid to allow for laminar flow. As shown in Figure 1, a wet film or coating (10) is formed on a moving web (20) in a machine direction (30). Before the wet film dries or cures, an air flow (40) is applied, from an air supply (50) (e.g., an air knife), in a direction substantially transverse to the machine direction (30). It was observed that the air flow can reduce or eliminate any preferential alignment of the nanowires that may occur during deposition. It is believed that the laminar flow across the wet film leads to a certain degree of reorientation of the nanowires, especially those that have previously aligned along the machine direction (i.e., perpendicular to the laminar flow). Thus, one embodiment provides a method of forming a conductive film, the method comprising: (a) providing a coating solution having a plurality of conductive nanostructures and a fluid carrier; (b) moving a web in a machine direction; (c) forming a wet film by depositing the coating solution on the moving web, wherein the wet film has a first dimension extending parallel to the machine direction and a second dimension transverse to the machine direction; (d) applying an air flow across the wet film along the second dimension, whereby at least some of the conductive nanostructures in the wet film are reoriented; and (e) allowing the wet film to dry to provide the conductive film. In various embodiments, the depositing step comprises continuously pressuring the coating solution from a reservoir onto the moving web (i.e., by a slot die method). In further various embodiments, the air flow is continuously applied as the wet film travels along the machine direction. Preferably, the air flow is applied immediately after the wet film is deposited, to ensure that the wet film is fluid enough to allow the conductive nanostructures to reorient themselves. The time interval between the deposition and air flow depends, to a certain extent, on the volatility and amount of the liquid carrier. For an aqueous-based coating solution, air flow should start within 5 seconds, or within 10 seconds, or within 20 seconds or within 30 seconds from deposition. It is important that at the time of the air flow, the film has not undergone any significant drying and therefore the nanowires could still be reoriented by external means. The air flow can be supplied by any means known to a skilled person in the art. Typically, the source of air flow may be, for example, an air knife located on one side of the moving web, or an air channel or duct overhanging the moving web. Also shown in Figures 2-5, the source of the air flow may be designed to provide a uniform air flow across the entire width of the wet film (i.e., along the second dimension). The wet film is then allowed to fully dry. Without the post-deposition treatment, the anisotropy of sheet resistance (defined as the ratio of TD sheet resistance to the MD sheet resistance) may be as high as 2. In various embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure, the anisotropy of the sheet resistance can be less than 2, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2. The laminar flow on the side proximal to the air supply, due to more air flow at this position, is typically stronger than the laminar flow at a lateral location farther away from the air supply. Consequently, the effect of the laminar flow on the alignment of the nanowires can also be more pronounced, as seen in the graph in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows the anisotropy of sheet resistance as a function of the locations of measurement in Sample A (without cross-web air flow) and Sample B (with cross-web air flow). The anisotropy on the right side (proximal to the air supply) was reduced from 2 to 1.2. On the left side (farther away from the air supply), the reduction was only from 2 to 1.4. In the set up as shown in Figure 2, a standard air knife is preferably used to generate air flow across the coated film. More specifically, a blower channeled through an approximately 15 cm \u03c7\u03c7\u03c7\u03c7 1 cm rectangular opening was placed at the level of the coated film approximately 0.5mm to 10mm from the edge of the coated film. The air velocity was from 0. lm/s to lOm/s and preferably around 1 m/s. The width of the coated film was 30 cm. As show in the graph of Figure 2, the anisotropy of the coated film was reduced from 2 or greater to 1.5 or less to produce a silver nanowire transparent conductive with an anisotropy of no more than 1.5. Figure 3 A and Figure 3B illustrate the effect of laminar flow as evidenced by the microscopic alignments of the nanowires. Figure 3A shows nanowire alignment in a conductive film without the air flow treatment. As shown, more nanowires are aligned in the machine direction (MD) that those that are not, indicating preferential alignments due to shear. For nanowires that have undergone laminar flow, as shown in Figure 3B, there is little evidence of preferential alignment due to the reorientation of the nanowires. Thus, a further embodiment provides a conductive film, wherein when a first sheet resistance along the first dimension (i.e., the machine direction) and a second sheet resistance along the second dimension (i.e., the transverse direction) are measured at a given location on the conductive film, a ratio of the second sheet resistance and the first sheet resistance defines an anisotropy of the sheet resistances, wherein the anisotropy is less than 2, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2, or in the range of 1-1.5, or in the range of 1.2-1.5, or in the range of 1.4-1.5. The sheet resistances along the MD (RMD) and TD (RTD) can be measured by first cutting out pieces of a coated film, for example, peaces that measure 5cm x 5cm each, and measuring by a two-point probe. Typically, the two-point probe has two stripes of conductive rubber (each 2.5cm long) that are spaced 2.5cm apart. Other dimensions are also suitable, as readily recognized by a skilled person in the art. Figures 2-3 also show that there may be some advantage to providing a cross-web flow with constant air-speed over the full width of the web in order to induce a more uniform reduction of the anisotropy at all points across the width of the web. Thus, in a further embodiment, anisotropies are measured at a plurality of locations across the second dimension to provide a maximum anisotropy and a minimum anisotropy, and wherein the difference between the maximum anisotropy and the minimum anisotropy is less than 25% of the minimum anisotropy. In other embodiments, the difference is less than 20%, or less than 15%, or less than 10%, or less than 5% of the minimum anisotropy. Shown in Figure 4 is a schematic design of a duct device (100) which channels the cross-web air flow to help create an air flow with constant velocity but does not touch the web. As shown, on a web (60) that is moving in a machine direction (70), a wet film (80) is formed through slot die deposition (90). Before the wet film (80) dries or cures, an air flow (110) is applied, from an air duct (100) in a direction substantially transverse to the machine direction (70). The duct should not touch the web directly, to avoid damaging or disturbing the wet coating. Some air may be lost because a hermetic seal is impossible to install between the duct and the web. To correct for this loss, the duct can be modified so that the cross section of the duct is smaller at the outlet than at the inlet. The duct may be placed close to a roller in the web coating line or close to a flat area between rollers. The duct may be fabricated of any suitable, rigid material (e.g., aluminum). Preferably, the duct is approximately 2.5 cm in width, 1 cm tall and spans the width of the coated film. The duct can have a semi-circular cross section, square cross section, rectangular cross section or other shaped cross section. The bottom edges of the duct are preferably placed from about 0.1mm to about 10mm from the top surface of the coated film. The duct can be coupled to an air supply source at the opening of the duct near the edge of the coated film, as shown in Figure 4. The source for the cross-flowing air can be a blower, air compressor or other cross-flow air source. In order to maintain a more constant air flow across the entire width of the coated film when using the rigid duct, the volume of the interior of the duct may be gradually reduced along its length. One embodiment of this structure is shown in Figure 5, which is a side view of one embodiment of a rigid duct 100 in accordance with the present disclosure. As shown, the cross-sectional area of the duct is reduced from the proximal air-supply end 120 of the duct to the distal end 140 of the duct. The air-supply end 120 is preferably coupled to a moving air supply, the upper sloped face of the duct 160 is closed and the lower face (180) of the duct is open to the coating film (not shown), which passes beneath the duct. In more general terms, a potential anisotropy in sheet resistance, regardless of the specific factors that give rise to the anisotropy, can be mitigated or eliminated by a method involving air flow. Thus, a further embodiment provides a method of forming a conductive film, the method comprising: (a) forming a wet film having a plurality of conductive nanostructures and a fluid carrier, wherein the wet film has a first dimension and a second dimension transverse to the first dimension; and (b) applying an air flow across the wet film along the second dimension, whereby at least some of the conductive nanostructures in the wet film are reoriented. In various further embodiments, the method comprises the step of allowing the wet film to dry to provide the conductive film after the air flow is applied. In a more specific embodiment, the wet film is continuously formed on a moving substrate, the moving substrate traveling along the first dimension. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the wet film is formed by slot die coating in a roll- to-roll process. In further embodiments, the air flow is continuously applied as the wet film travels. The conductive film thus formed is characterized with an anisotropy, as defined herein, of less than 2. In more specific embodiments, the anisotropy is less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2, or in the range of 1-1.5, or in the range of 1.2-1.5, or in the range of 1.4- 1.5. Thus, one embodiment provides A conductive film comprising a plurality of conductive nanostructures, wherein a first dimension of the conductive film is perpendicular to a second dimension of the conductive film and a first sheet resistance (RMD) along the first dimension and a second sheet resistance (RTD) along the second dimension are measured at a given location on the conductive film, and wherein a ratio (RTD /RMD) of the second sheet resistance and the first sheet resistance defines an anisotropy of the sheet resistances, wherein the anisotropy is less than 2, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.4, or less than 1.2. In various other embodiments, the anisotropies are measured at a plurality of locations across the second dimension to provide a maximum anisotropy and a minimum anisotropy, and wherein the difference between the maximum anisotropy and the minimum anisotropy is less than 25%, or less than 20%, or less than 15%, or less than 10%, or less than 5% of the minimum anisotropy. The various components are described in more detail below. Conductive Nanostructures Generally speaking, the transparent conductors described herein are thin conductive films of conductive nanostructures. In the transparent conductor, one or more electrically conductive paths are established through continuous physical contacts among the nanostructures. A conductive network of nanostructures is formed when sufficient nanostructures are present to reach an electrical percolation threshold. The electrical percolation threshold is therefore an important value above which long range connectivity can be achieved. As used herein, \"conductive nanostructures\" or \"nanostructures\" generally refer to electrically conductive nano-sized structures, at least one dimension of which is less than 500nm, more preferably, less than 250nm, lOOnm, 50nm or 25nm. The nanostructures can be of any shape or geometry. In certain embodiments, the nanostructures are isotropically shaped (i.e., aspect ratio = 1). Typical isotropic nanostructures include nanoparticles. In preferred embodiments, the nanostructures are anisotropically shaped (i.e., aspect ratio\u2260 1). As used herein, \"aspect ratio\" refers to the ratio between the length and the width (or diameter) of the nanostructure. The anisotropic nanostructure typically has a longitudinal axis along its length. Exemplary anisotropic nanostructures include nanowires and nanotubes, as defined herein. The nanostructures can be solid or hollow. Solid nanostructures include, for example, nanoparticles and nanowires. \"Nanowires\" thus refers to solid anisotropic nanostructures. Typically, each nanowire has an aspect ratio (length: diameter) of greater than 10, preferably greater than 50, and more preferably greater than 100. Typically, the nanowires are more than 500nm, more than l um, or more than \u0399\u039f\u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 long. Hollow nanostructures include, for example, nanotubes. Typically, the nanotube has an aspect ratio (length: diameter) of greater than 10, preferably greater than 50, and more preferably greater than 100. Typically, the nanotubes are more than 500nm, more than \u0399\u03bc\u03b9\u03b7, or more than \u0399\u039f\u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 in length. The nanostructures can be formed of any electrically conductive material. Most typically, the conductive material is metallic. The metallic material can be an elemental metal (e.g., transition metals) or a metal compound (e.g., metal oxide). The metallic material can also be a bimetallic material or a metal alloy, which comprises two or more types of metal. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, silver, gold, copper, nickel, gold-plated silver, platinum and palladium. The conductive material can also be non-metallic, such as carbon or graphite (an allotrope of carbon). Conductive Film Through a solution-based approach, a conductive film is first formed as a wet film by depositing an ink composition on a substrate, the ink composition comprising a plurality of nanostructures and a liquid carrier. As the liquid carrier (a volatile component) of the wet film fully dries, a conductive film is formed. The conductive film comprises nanostructures that are randomly distributed and interconnect with one another. As the number of the nanostructures reaches the percolation threshold, the thin film is electrically conductive. Thus, unless specified otherwise, as used herein, \"conductive film\" refers to a nanostructure network layer formed of networking and percolative nanostructures combined with any of the nonvolatile components of the ink composition, including, for example, one or more of the following: viscosity modifier, surfactant and corrosion inhibitor. The liquid carrier for the dispersion may be water, an alcohol, a ketone or a combination thereof. Exemplary alcohols may include isopropanol (IP A), ethanol, diacetone alcohol (DAA) or a combination of IP A and DAA. Exemplary ketones may include methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and methyl propyl ketone (MPK). The surfactants serve to reduce aggregation of the nanostructures and/or the light-scattering material. Representative examples of suitable surfactants include fluorosurfactants such as ZONYL\u017d surfactants, including ZONYL\u017d FSN, ZONYL\u017d FSO, ZONYL\u017d FSA, ZONYL\u017d FSH (DuPont Chemicals, Wilmington, DE), and NOVEC\u0099 (3M, St. Paul, MN). Other exemplary surfactants include non-ionic surfactants based on alkylphenol ethoxylates. Preferred surfactants include, for example, octylphenol ethoxylates such as TRITON\u0099 (xlOO, xl 14, x45), and nonylphenol ethoxylates such as TERGITOL\u0099 (Dow Chemical Company, Midland MI). Further exemplary non-ionic surfactants include acetylenic-based surfactants such as DYNOL\u017d (604, 607) (Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, PA) and n- dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside. The viscosity modifier serves as a binder that immobilizes the nanostructures on a substrate. Examples of suitable viscosity modifiers include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose, xanthan gum, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxy methyl cellulose, and hydroxy ethyl cellulose. In particular embodiments, the weight ratio of the surfactant to the viscosity modifier in the coating solution is preferably in the range of about 80: 1 to about 0.01 : 1; the weight ratio of the viscosity modifier to the conductive nanostructures is preferably in the range of about 5 : 1 to about 0.000625 : 1 ; and the weight ratio of the conductive nanostructures to the surfactant is preferably in the range of about 560: 1 to about 5: 1. The ratios of components of the coating solution may be modified depending on the substrate and the method of application used. A preferred viscosity range for the coating solution is between about 1 cP and 100 cP. The electrical conductivity of the conductive film is often measured by \"sheet resistance,\" which is represented by Ohms/square (or \"ohms/sq\"). The sheet resistance is a function of at least the surface loading density, the size/shapes of the nanostructures, and the intrinsic electrical property of the nanostructure constituents. As used herein, a thin film is considered conductive if it has a sheet resistance of no higher than 108 ohms/sq. Preferably, the sheet resistance is no higher than 104 ohms/sq, 3,000 ohms/sq, 1,000 ohms/sq, or 350 ohms/sq, or 100 ohms/sq. Typically, the sheet resistance of a conductive network formed by metal nanostructures is in the ranges of from 10 ohms/sq to 1000 ohms/sq, from 100 ohms/sq to 750 ohms/sq, from 50 ohms/sq to 200 ohms/sq, from 100 ohms/sq to 500 ohms/sq, or from 100 ohms/sq to 250 ohms/sq, or from 10 ohms/sq to 200 ohms/sq, from 10 ohms/sq to 50 ohms/sq, or from 1 ohms/sq to 10 ohms/sq. For the opto-electrical devices described herein, the sheet resistance is typically less than 20 ohms/square, or less than 15 ohms/square, or less than 10 ohms/square. Optically, the nanostructure-based transparent conductors have high light transmission in the visible region (400nm-700nm). Typically, the transparent conductor is considered optically clear when the light transmission is more than 70%, or more typically more than 85% in the visible region. More preferably, the light transmission is more than 90%, more than 93%, or more than 95%. As used herein, unless specified otherwise, a conductive film is optically transparent (e.g., more than 70% in transmission). Thus, the terms transparent conductor, transparent conductive film, layer or coating, conductive film, layer or coating, and transparent electrode are used interchangeably.

It has been discovered that many sedimentary sample's recovered from I earth strata have connate anisotropic magnetic properties which are present therein by reason of the inclusion during. the period of sedimentation of quantities of magnetic mineral particles which oriented themselves under the influence of the earth's magnetic field at the time of sedimentation. Certain igneous rocks also display anisotropic magnetic properties which are attributable to the minerals during the slow cooling conditions usually attendant upon the past history of such rock formation. Whatever may be the cause, it has been discovered that many rock samples of both sedimentary and igneous origin display definitely oriented magnetic and electrical properties. It is an object of this invention to present a method and apparatus for detecting and determining the presence and orientation of such connate anisotropic magnetic properties in earth formations. I r The determination of magnetic anisotropy of such bodies by means of an astatic magnetometer is known but such methods are often limited .in sensitivity and subject to error caused by the tendency of the magnetometer magnets to induce extraneous magnetic polarities within the magnetic materials comprisingthe earth test samples. It is, therefore, a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for determining magnetic anisotropy of earth's strata samples which are accurate and of suflicient sensitivlty to be applicable to earth samples having only slight anistropic characteristics. The determination of the orientation of the axis of anistropy of the earth stratasamples has its chief application as an aid to the determination of the dip and strike of remote or deep earth strata from which the samples have been removed, for example, deep strata from which drilled core samples have been taken in the proc- 'essofo1lwe1ldrilling. It has been shown that the magnetic polar axis of recovered formation samples correspond in oriented formation of. crystals of ferro magnetic magnetic axis of a core sample and with the direction of the magnetic fleld in the formation from which the core has been recovered known and with the vertical inclination of the bore hole 1 from which the core has been recovered also known, the original position of thecore within the stratum is established. It the thus oriented core sample shows stratification, as it often does, the dip and strike of such strata is also thus established. The method and apparatus of the present invention, however, is in itself adapted only to the determination of the axisof magnetic anisotropy within a recovered core sample and other means must be employed to determine the actual magnetic polarity thereof, In core samples which have extremely feeble magnetic polarization it is often possible to determine the polarity once the axis of the magnetic anisotropy is accurately ,established. The method of the inventioncomprises inductive relation to. an inductance coil and rotating the core sample into various angular positions with respect to the field of said inductance coil and, by suitable means, simultaneously observing and correlating the relative variations of the inductance or impedance of the electrical cir- A cuit comprising said inductance coil with said varied angular-positions of the core sample.

Figure 6 is a plan view of the core orientation dial taken is 'a'conventional heterodyne frequency meter. in brief, placing a core sample which is to betested in from tests made in accordance with the present invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the apparatus comprises an inductance comprising a plurality of turns ofwire wound in two sections, as shown at In and II, upon suitable cylindrical dielectric forms l2 and 13 which are supported at the outer 7 ends within a rectangular metallic shielding enclosure I4. The metallic enclosure I4 is provided at the central portion of the top and bottom surfaces thereof with circular openings l5 and i6 through which a cylindrical dielectric tube I1 is supported on a vertical axis. The said cylindrical dielectric tube I1 is thus supported intermediate the inner ends of the tubes l2 and I3 upon which the two sections of the inductance I8 and H are wound. The dielectric tube I1 carries an electrostatic shield comprising a plurality of longitudinally positioned parallel fine wires equally spaced about the outside surface as best shown at l8 in Figures 3 and 4. These wires may be atached to the outside surface of the dielectric tube I? by suitable adhesive, such as liquid Bakelite (a phenol-formaldehyde condensation product) or cellulose nitrate or acetate lacquer. The wires I8 are all electrically connected at one end with a common conductor, as shown at I9, which is grounded to the shield enclosure as shown at 20. The longitudinal wires l8 thus supported on the dielectric tube I! form an electrostatic shield for the cylindrical opening which the tube' l1 provides through the center portion of the enclosure 14 between the two sections of the inductance Ill-ll. Upper and lower pivots 22 and 23 positioned coaxially with respect to the cylindrical opening formed by the dielectric tube I! are provided for supporting a cylindrically shaped core sample, as illustrated at 25. The lower pivot 23 is supported in a fixed position upon a horizontal member 25 which is in turn supported at its ends by means of metal uprights 21 and 28. The upper pivot point 22 is retained in a position coaxial with the tube l1 and the pivot 23 by means of a bushing 38 through which it is free to move vertically. The said bushing is in turn supported by a hinged horizontal member 3| which is also supported at its ends by the beforementioned uprights 21 and 28. The said supporting member 3| is provided at one end with a hinge, as shown at 32 and with a thumb screw at the opposite end, as shown at 33, whereby it may be raised and pivoted about the hinge 32 as a center to facilitate introduction and removal of the test core sample. The pivot 22 is provided at the top with a wheel 35 by means of which it may be rotated by hand and at the lower end adjacent the point it is provided with a spade shaped member, as shown at 36, which is adapted to rest within a diametrically positioned slot cut in the end of the cylindrical core sample 25. Both of the pivots 22 and 23 are preferably composed of an insulating material, such as glass, hard rubberflBakelite,\" or other suitable dielectric, non-magnetic material, A graduated disc 38 composed of a nonmagnetic, dielectric material, such as Celluloid is adapted to rest on the top end of the core sample, as best shown in Figure 6. The-center of the disc 38 is provided with a circularopening 39 and radial slots 40 and II through which the pivot 22 and spade 35 pass. Slots and 4| are adaptpointer 43, supported at 44 on the upper surface of the metallic enclosure H, is provided for indicating the rotational position of the core sample 25 upon the graduations of the disc 38. The metallic enclosure H which houses the inductance Ill-ll is supported at its outer ends by means of the before mentioned uprights 21 and 28 upon a metallic instrument box 46 which contains the vacuum tube oscillator, hereinafter described. The two, sections l8 and II of the inductance are connected in series by means of a conductor within the enclosure l4, as shown at 41, and thesaid inductance is in turn connected to the vacuum tube oscillator circuit within the instrument box 46 by means of conductors 49 and 50 which pass from the enclosure H to the instrument box 45 through metallic shielding tubes 5| and 52. The vacuum tube oscillator circuit comprising the inductance Ill-ll and the apparatus housed within the instrument box 46 is a conventional shunt fed colpitts type selfexcited oscillator the wiring diagram of which is illustrated in Figure 5. The apparatus within the instrument box 46 comprises a three element vacuum tube '54, fixed stopping condensers 55. and 5B, variable tuning condensers C1, C2, grid leak 51 and radio frequency chokes 58 and 59. Terminals B- and 3+ are provided for connecting the oscillator circuit to a suitable high volt-' age plate supply which may be a dry battery of approximately 45 to 90 volts. The terminals B- and A are provided for connection to the filament current supply which may be a dry battery or storage battery of approximately 2 /2 to 6 volts. Figure 7 illustrates a well known and conventional type of a heterodyne frequency meter comprising a detector, a vacuum tube heterodyne oscillator and a loud speaker. The frequency of the heterodyne oscillator is adapted to be coned to retain the said disc 38 in a fixed rotational position with respect to the core sample 25 and, are thus adapted to be rotated together with the core sample 25 by means ofhand wheel 85. A trolled by means of a variable condenser in the circuit which is operated by means of the control knob 65 which'in turn carries a graduated dial 6|. A pointer 62 serves to indicate the position of the control knob 58 uponthe dial 6|. The out- I- put of the detector and heterodyne oscillator leads to a loud speaker, the opening of which is shown The operation of the apparatus of the invention is as follows: The core recovered from a drilling hole which is to be tested is first placed in a lathe or other suitable apparatus and turned down to a true cylindrical form having a diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the opening through the tube l'l, as shown at 25. The turned core sample isalso provided with centers at either end to receive the points of the supporting pivots 22 and 23 and one end of the core sample is also provided wth a suitable slot into which the spade 35 carried on the pivot 22 may be inserted. The core sample to be tested is then placed between the supporting pivot points 22 and 23, as shown in Figure 1, and dial 38 is placed upon the top end in a known angular position with respect to a iO-li and by reason of the position of the core sample 25 intermediate the two sections \"and II of this inductance, the high frequency alternating field passes through the central portion of the core sample. The core sample is thus subjected to the influence of the high frequency electromagnetic field from the inductance llI-.-l I. Since the impedance of the inductance lll is dependent in part upon the permeability of the path through which the high frequency electromagnetic field passes any variation in such permeability will consequently cause a variation in said impedance. Therefore, if the core sample, as shown at 25, under test is anisotropic with re-' spect to its permeability a rotation of this core sample by means of the hand wheel 35 acting through the pivot 22 will cause a corresponding variation'in the permeability of the magnetic path between the two sections it and ii of the inductance. Such variation in permeability of the magnetic path will then result in a corresponding varlation in the effective impedance of the inductance iii-Ii which will in turn result ina corresponding variation in frequency of the vacuum tube oscillatory circuit of which the inductance ill-ii forms a controlling part. In testing the core sample in this manner it is imparted slow or intermittent rotation by means of the hand wheel 35. During such slow or 'intermittent rotation of the core sample the heterodyne frequency meter of Figure 'l is constantly adjusted by means of control knob 60 to a zero beat frequency with the oscillator circuit of the test instrument. As the core sample 25 is continued to be rotated the slight deviation-in frequency of the oscillatory circuit caused thereby will be indicated by heterodyne in the heterodyne frequency meter of Figure, '7. During the slow rotation of the core sample 25 the heterodyne frequency meter may be maintained at all times at zero beat frequency with the oscillator of the test apparatus-by constant adjustment by means of the control 60. The varying position of the control 60 is indicated by means of the pointer 62 upon the dial 6i. The corresponding positions of the core sample 25 are indicated by means of the pointer 43 upon the graduated dial 38. The corresponding readings of the two dials and BI may, for convenience, be plotted on cross section paper as illustrated in Figure 8 in which the L abscissa is plotted in degrees of the rotational position of the coresample 25 as indicated on dial 38 and the ordinate is plotted in degrees of rotation of the frequency meter control 60 as indicated 'on the dial M. In a typical core sample the resultant graph appears as a curve having substantially sine wave form, as shown at 65. . The peaks 'of the curve 65 as shown, for example, at, an angular positionof the core sample of approximately 68 and 243 are indicative of the planes of minimum permeability while the valleys indicated at approximately 153 and 333' are indicative of the planes of maximum perme-' ability. These planes of maximum permeability are, obviously, 180 apart and the same is true of the planes of minimum permeability. Therefore, we find as indicated in .Figure 8 two positions of maximum and two positions of minimum frequency of the oscillator per revolution of the core sample. Having thus arrived at the angles of maximum 'and minimum permeability of the core sample 28, as rotated about the centers 22 and 23, the said core sample 25 may be suitably marked in accordance with theindications of the dial II to indicate thereon such determined planes of maximum and minimum permeability. During the core testing operations, as hereinbefore described, the heterodyne frequency meter 5 M should be placed at the maximum possible dis-A tance from the oscillator of the core testing apparatus at which the stray radiated high frequency field is still of sufiicient strength to be picked up by the frequency meter detector and the resulting heterodyne audibly reproduced in the loud speaker. This stray field in general is quite weak due to the metal shielding provided by the enclosures of both the core testing oscillator and the heterodyne frequency meter. When testing core samples having strongly de-. fined anisotropic magnetic permeabilities it is possible at times to merely set th heterodyne frequency meter in such a manner as to produce an audible beat of any suitable frequency, say for example a frequency of 50. to 100 cycles per. record and then while rotating the core sample in the test instrument to simply observe the points as indicated on the dial 38 where the varying beat frequency reaches a minimum and maxiquency meter. a In general it is desirable to employ an oscillater circuit in the core testing instrument which has constants such asto produce frequencies in the neighborhood of from 100 to 10,000 kilocycles. The instrument is most sensitive in the higher range of frequencies. When the core sample containsdrilling fluid or connate water which is highly conductive it is desirable to bakethe core sample at a relatively high temperature for a time sufiicient to remove 0 trical circuit and correlating the relative variations of impedance of said electrical circuit ef-' ,fected thereby with the varied angular positions of said core sample, and locating therefrom an'axis ofelectrical anisotropy of said core sample. 2.

        "Description": "Description PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority as a divisional application to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/700,308, entitled \u0093Binary Anistropy Media,\u0094 filed Jan. 31, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,211,557, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND In conventional hard disk drives, the area density capability is limited by the inability to generate sufficient magnetic field so that the anisotropy field of each magnetic grain in a disk medium is artificially constrained. Such constraints limit the minimal size of magnetic grains in the media, hence limiting the area density that can be reached with sufficient magnetic thermal stability of the disk media and sufficient signal-to-medium-noise ratio. An alternative approach is to use heat to assist the recording process. At an elevated temperature, the field required to reverse the magnetic moment orientation in the storage layer of the media becomes significantly smaller than that at ambient. This scheme is known as heat assisted magnetic recording, i.e., HAMR. However, current HAMR technology utilizes a Curie point writing mechanism in which the write temperature exceeds the Curie temperature of the media. When the medium cools down to below Curie temperature, magnetization re-occurs in the presence of a recording field and the recording of a data bit is accomplished. The Curie temperature writing scheme requires the recording media to be heated to a relatively high temperature that could cause medium structural variation. Further, the re-occurrence of the uniform magnetization appears to be relatively slow and also requires rapid heat dissipation perpendicular to the film to prevent lateral expansion of the thermal energy. U.S. Pat. No. 6,834,026 to Fullerton discloses a magnetic recording medium for thermally-assisted recording that comprises a bilayer of a high-coercivity, high-anisotropy ferromagnetic material and a switching material, like FeRh, that exhibits a switch from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic at a transition temperature less than the Currie temperature of the high-coercivity, high-anisotropy ferromagnetic material. SUMMARY In one general aspect, the present invention is directed to a magnetic microstructure, sometimes referred to below as \u0093binary anisotropy media\u0094 (or \u0093BAM\u0094), that enables robust data recording at a temperature significantly below the Curie temperature, but still above the ambient temperature. According to various embodiments, the magnetic microstructure comprises (i) a magnetic storage layer having a magnetic easy axis perpendicular to the film plane; (ii) a magnetic assist layer having a magnetic easy axis in the film plane; and (iii) a phase transition interlayer between the magnetic storage layer and the magnetic assist layer. The phase transition layer comprises a material, such as FeRh, that switches from antiferromagnetic at ambient to ferromagnetic at a transition temperature that is greater than ambient, but below the Curie temperature of the phase transition interlayer (and preferably below the Curie temperatures of the perpendicular and in-plane magnetic layers). When the phase transition interlayer is in the antiferromagnetic phase (or non-magnetic phase), there exists little magnetic coupling between the storage and assist layers. When the interlayer changes to the ferromagnetic phase (i.e., when it is heated to or above the transition temperature), the interlayer couples the magnetic moments of the storage and assist layers ferromagnetically. As a result, in contrast to prior art magnetic recording media such as disclosed in the Fullerton patent mentioned above, if the anisotropy field-thickness product of the two layers is similar and the coupling is sufficiently strong, the effective magnetic anisotropy of the storage layer and the assist layer essentially vanishes. That way, the required write field at the recording temperature (a temperature at or above the transition temperature) needs only to be a few percent of the ambient anisotropy field of the storage layer. This enables, in various embodiments, recording to occur in the deep sub-nanosecond regime and with much less heating energy than that used in Curie temperature writing. Further, the transition temperature can be tuned by the addition of other elements, such as Ir, so that the anisotropy switching occurs at a desired temperature. In other general aspects, the present invention is directed to magnetic recording media including the binary anisotropy media layer as well as a magnetic memory cell including the binary anisotropy media layer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a side view of a magnetic microstructure 10, or binary anisotropy media (BAM), according to various embodiments of the present invention. The binary anisotropy media 10 may be used to store binary data such as in a magnetic recording medium or in a magnetic memory unit (e.g., a magnetic random access memory (MRAM) unit), as described further below. As shown in FIG. 1, the BAM 10 may comprise a magnetic storage layer 12, a phase transition interlayer 14, and a magnetic assist layer 16. The phase transition layer 14 is between the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16. In FIG. 1, the storage layer 12 is above the assist layer 16. In the example of FIG. 2, the storage layer 12 is below the assist layer 16. The magnetic storage layer 12 may comprise small magnetic grains, each with a strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and a magnetic easy axis perpendicular to the film plane. With reference to the Cartesian coordinates shown in FIG. 1, the magnetic easy axis (indicated by the vertical arrow in magnetic storage layer 10 in FIG. 1) may be in the z-direction and the film plane is in the x-y plane in this example. The magnetic assist layer 16 may also comprise small magnetic grains, each grain having a strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and a magnetic easy axis in the film plane (i.e., in the x-direction in the example) as indicated by the horizontal arrow in the magnetic assist layer 16 in FIG. 1. The magnetic layers 12, 16 may comprise magnetic materials such as, for example, Co alloys, FePt (L10), CoPt, FePd, AlMn, or other L10 materials. The thickness of the storage layer 12 and assist layer 16 may vary depending on the materials used. For instance, the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16 may each have thicknesses of between 5 nm and 20 nm. The phase transition interlayer 14 is between the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16. The phase transition interlayer 14 may comprise a material with small magnetic grains that switches from antiferromagnetic at ambient to ferromagnetic at or above a transition temperature (TA-F) that is greater than ambient. One such material is FeRh, which experiences a first order phase transformation at a transition temperature TA-F that can range from 300\u00b0 K and 500\u00b0 K, depending on the film texture and the underlayer used. This is much less than the Curie temperature for FeRh, which is in the range of 673\u00b0 K to 950\u00b0 K. Also, such heating (e.g., 300\u00b0 K to 500\u00b0 K) typically would have little effect on the perpendicular and in-plane magnetic layers 12, 16. As shown in FIG. 3, the phase below the transition temperature TA-F is antiferromagnetic while above the transition temperature the material becomes ferromagnetic. The sharp transition between antiferromagnetic phase and ferromagnetic phase, as shown in the example of FIG. 3, effectively enhances the spatial gradient and limits the size of the phase transformed spot. Recent experimental study has shown that the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transformation occurs well within the deep sub-nanosecond regime. The phase transition interlayer 14 may have a thickness of between 1 nm and 10 nm, for example. In another embodiment, the phase transition interlayer 14 may comprise Fex(Rd100-yMy)100-x, where M is selected from the group consisting of Ir, Pt, Ru, Re, and Os. In addition, y is preferably between zero and fifteen inclusive (i.e., 0\u2266y\u226615). Addition of the third element M may allow the transition temperature to be tuned (e.g., increased). FIG. 4 shows how the transition temperature can be increased by adding 3% Ir. Other possible materials for the phase transition interlayer 14 include MnZn, SmZn, GdZn, TbZn, DyZn, HoZn, and ErZn. The magnetic grains in all three layers 12, 14, 16, due to the nature of the film growth may be aligned in the direction perpendicular (the z-direction with reference to the Cartesian coordinates shown in FIG. 1) to the film (which is in the x-y plane in this example). Also, the grain boundaries are preferably near or completely non-magnetic to decouple the (lateral) ferromagnetic exchange coupling among grains in the same layer. According to various embodiments, when the interlayer 14 is in antiferromagnetic phase (or non-magnetic phase), there exists little magnetic coupling between the two adjacent ferromagnetic layers 12, 16. When the interlayer 14 changes to ferromagnetic phase (i.e., when it is heated to or above the transition temperature TA-F), the interlayer 14 couples the magnetic moments of the two adjacent layers 12, 16 ferromagnetically. The exchange coupling between the phase transition interlayer 14 and the in-plane magnetic layer 16 causes the in-plane magnetic layer 16 to exert an effective magnetic field that is significantly stronger (such as 100 times stronger) that fields that can be applied artificially (e.g., externally applied). As a result, an in contrast to prior art magnetic recording media such as disclosed in the Fullerton patent mentioned above, if the anisotropy field-thickness product of the two layers 12, 16 is similar and the coupling is sufficiently strong, the effective magnetic anisotropy of the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16 essentially vanishes. Hence, writing of the storage layer 12 can be easily achieved with a field that needs only to be a few percent of the ambient anisotropy field of the storage layer 12. The exchange coupling strength for the interlayer 14 in the ferromagnetic phase can be tuned by changing the interlayer thickness since the coupling energy density per unit film surface area is: \u03c3 \u2248 2 A F \u03b4 where AF is the exchange stiffness constant of the interlayer 14 in the ferromagnetic phase, which can be estimated via its Curie temperature, and \u03b4 is the interlayer thickness. FIG. 5 shows the calculated switching field for a storage layer 12 whose anisotropy field is Hk=200 kOe at ambient. At \u03c3=1.5 erg/cm2, the switching field of the storage layer 12 becomes around 6 kOe due to the coupling with the magnetic moment of the assist layer 16. Such interlayer exchange coupling can be reached with a FeRh interlayer of a thickness 10 nm or less. Note in the calculation results presented in FIG. 5, the saturation magnetization of the assist layer 16 is chosen to be significantly smaller than that of the storage layer 12 to prevent the irreversible magnetization switching in the assist layer 16. If the corresponding grains of the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16 have the exact same volume, saturation magnetization, and anisotropy energy constant, the magnetic moments of the two grains rotate coherently during the reversal. Similar reduction of the switching field of the storage layer 12 under a perpendicular external field as a function of the exchange coupling strength is obtained. FIG. 6 shows the calculated magnetic hysteresis loops of the storage layer 12 for the structure in FIG. 5 with a perpendicularly oriented external magnetic field. The outer, hatched loop shows the calculated hysteresis loop where the temperature of the interlayer 14 is below the transition temperature TA-F. The inner, solid loop shows the calculated hysteresis loop where the temperature of the interlay 14 is above the transition temperature TA-F. The planar demagnetization field is neglected here to show the intrinsic switching of a grain in the storage layer 12. The interlayer coupling between the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16, mediated by the interlayer 14 while in ferromagnetic phase, significantly reduces the switching field and produces a robust switching, as shown in the example of FIG. 6. FIGS. 7A-C illustrate the magnetic structure 10 at various temperatures. FIG. 7A shows the structure 10 when the temperature of the interlayer 14 is below the transition temperature. FIGS. 7A-C also show the magnetic moments of the phase transition interlayer 14. In this temperature range, the interlayer 14 is antiferromagnetic and there is little coupling between the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16. FIG. 7B shows the structure 10 after it has been heated to or above the transition temperature TA-F. The structure 10 may be heated using a laser, for example. As shown in FIG. 7B, when the temperature of the interlayer 14 is above the transition temperature TA-F (but below the Curie temperature), the interlayer 14 is ferromagnetic, resulting in ferromagnetic exchange coupling between the storage layer 12 and the assist layer 16, substantially reducing the switching field of the storage layer 12. As such, as shown in FIG. 7C, a magnetic field H at conventional strength can cause the magnetization of the storage layer 12 to reverse its direction. The heat may then be removed and the interlayer 14 may cool to a temperature below the transition temperature TA-F, with the magnetization of the storage layer 12 remaining in its reversed state. In this way, the structure 10 can be used for recording binary data. FIGS. 8A-B show the magnetic structure 10 according to other embodiments of the present invention. In the embodiment of FIG. 8A, there are two assist layers 16 a-b and two interlayers 14 a-b. One interlayer 14 a is between the upper assist layer 16 a and the upper surface of the storage layer 12. The other interlayer 14 b is between the lower assist layer 16 b and the lower surface of the storage layer 12. In such an embodiment, the interlayer exchange coupling strength is effectively doubled. In the embodiment of FIG. 8B, the magnetic structure includes magnetic interlayers 21 between the interlayer 14 and the respective magnetic layers 12, 16. The magnetic interlayers 21 may be used to enhance the magnetic coupling between the interlayer 14 and the magnetic layers 12, 16. The interlayers 21 are preferably relatively thin, such as on the order of one to ten nm in thickness. As shown in FIG. 9, the BAM layer 10 may be formed on a soft magnetic underlayer (SUL) 20. The SUL 20 may (1) enhance the perpendicular magnetic field for switching the magnetization of the storage layer 12 and/or (2) shunt the magnetic flux generated by the assist layer 16 and enhance the magnetic flux generated by the storage layer 12. Also as shown in FIG. 9, the BAM layer 10 may be formed on a seed layer 22. The seed layer 22 may be used to enhance the growth of the layers of the BAM layer 10. The various layers may be sequentially formed on a substrate (not shown) using conventional thin film deposition techniques. The seed underlayer 22 may comprise Ruthenium or MgO, for example. The SUL 20 may comprise, for example, FeSiCo, cobalt-zirconium-tantalum (CZT), or Co-alloy/Ru/Co-alloy. For a magnetic recording medium using the magnetic structure 10, the substantial reduction of the switching field of the storage layer grains with the interlayer exchange coupling, occurring when the interlayer 14 is heated to its ferromagnetic phase, enables the recording in a storage media with extremely high anisotropy field. Therefore, the size of the grains can be drastically reduced while still maintaining sufficient thermal magnetic stability. FIG. 10 shows a calculated grain size for the grains in the storage layer 12 as a function of the anisotropy energy constant according to an embodiment of the present invention. A thickness of 15 nm is assumed for the storage layer 12 and a constraint of an energy barrier of 60 kBT at room temperature is imposed. The grain size reduction may directly translate to an area density increase, as shown in FIG. 11. With the proposed medium microstructure, recording can be achieved at moderately elevated temperatures, around 150\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., with robust recording, significantly alleviating many thermal management issues presented with Curie temperature writing. Both the phase transition of the interlayer 14 and the magnetic switching of the storage layer 12 can occur within a small fraction of a nanosecond. The proposed medium could be used with HAMR in hard disk drives. Since the transition temperature can be tuned by adding certain elements, such as Ir, the phase transition of the interlayer 14 could be engineered so that the anisotropy switching occurs at a desired temperature. As such, as shown in FIG. 12, a write head 30 having a heating element 32 could be used to write data to a magnetic recording medium 34 comprised of the binary anisotropy media 10 described above. The heating element 32 may be a resistive heating element or it could be a laser, for example. Magnetic shields (or poles) 36 may be positioned on each side of the heating element 32. The shields 36 may be fabricated, for example, from a soft magnetic material such as, for example, nickel-iron (NiFe). The write head 30 may also include an inductive write element (not shown) for writing data to the medium 34. The write head 30 may be part of a read/write head that also comprises a read sensor (such as a GMR sensor) for sensing data recorded on the medium. FIG. 13 is a top plan view of the recording medium 34. FIG. 14 is a diagram of a write head 30 according to another embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the write head 30 comprises a leading shield 40, an inductive write element 42 and a trailing shield 44. The inductive write element 42 may comprise a number of windings 46 around a magnetic core 48. As shown in FIG. 14, the write head 30 may also include a heating element 41 and a conductor 43 between the write element 42 and the trailing shield 44. The heating element 41 may be made from a material that conducts electricity but that also has a relatively high electrical resistivity, such as Tungsten. The conductor 43 may be made from an electrical conductor with a low resistivity, such as Cu or Ag. The write head 30 may also include an insulator 45 insulating the trailing shield 44. That way, current, supplied from a current source 47, can flow through the trailing shield 44 and the conductor 43 to the heating element 41 to thereby cause the heating element 41 to heat the BAM layer in the recording medium 34. The binary anisotropy media 10 may also be used as part of a magnetic storage layer for a magnetic memory element in a magnetic memory device (e.g., a MRAM). FIG. 15 is a side view of a magnetic memory element 50 according to one such embodiment. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the storage layer for the magnetic memory element 50 comprises a BAM layer 10, including the storage layer 12, the phase transition interlayer 14, and the magnetic assist layer 16. The memory element 50 also comprises a reference layer 52 and a middle layer 54 that is between the BAM layer 10 and the reference layer 52. The reference layer 52 may include a magnetic material such as, for example, a multi-layer structure of Co/Pt, Co/Pd, or Co/Ni. The middle layer 54 may comprise (i) an upper spin polarization layer 56 next to the storage layer 12, (ii) a lower spin polarization layer 58, and (iii) an interlayer 60 between the upper and lower spin polarization layers. The spin polarization layers 56, 58 may comprise CoFe, CoFeB, or Co, for example. In various embodiments, the interlayer 60 acts as barrier layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure. In such embodiments, the interlayer 60 may comprise an insulative material, such as Al2O3, TiOx, or MgO, for example. In other embodiments, the interlayer 60 may provide a magnetoresistive structure, in which case the interlayer 60 may comprise an electrically conductive material, such as Cu, for example. As shown in FIG. 15, the magnetic memory element 50 may also comprise upper and lower electrical contact layers 62, 64 to thereby provide electrodes for the magnetic memory element 50. The electrical contact layers 62, 64 may comprise an electrically conductive material such as Cu, for example. FIG. 16 is a diagram of a memory cell 70 according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the magnetic memory element 50 is connected to a switch 70 (e.g., a FET). A write line 72 injects current into the magnetic memory element 50 when the switch 70 is conductive. Heat from the current through the magnetic memory element 50 can be used to heat the interlayer 14 to or above the transition temperature. FIG. 17 is a diagram of a memory cell 80 according to another embodiment of the present invention and FIG. 18 is a diagram of an array 82 of such memory cells 80. The illustrated embodiment utilizes two sets of current lines. A first write line 84, when activated, selects a row of the memory cells 80. The second set of write lines 86 are adjacent to the memory elements 50 and, when activated, carry current in the opposite direction to maximize the field strength of the addressed memory element 50 while minimizing the field on the half-select elements in the same row. As shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, the first write line 84 may comprise a heating element 88 for each memory element 50. The heating element 88 may be comprised of an electrically conductive material with a relatively high electrical resistance, such as Tungsten. When a particular memory element is selected and its corresponding write line 84 is activated, the current in the write line 84 may cause the heating element 88 to heat the interlayer 14 of the BAM layer 10 of the memory element 50, as described above. As shown in FIG. 18, each memory element 50 of the array 80 may have an associated heating element 88. The recording media 34 described above, including the BAM layer 10, may be used in a magnetic disk drive system, for example.

Field of the Invention This invention relates to investigation of earth formation and, more particularly, to a method for determining properties of earth formations, such as fracture systems, using compressional wave data recorded by present-day sonic well-logging tools. 2. Background of the Invention The present invention provides an improved acoustic well-logging method for estimating anisotropic formations in well-logging; particularly, it relates to an improved method for analyzing and interpreting well-logging data by using compressional instead of shear wave anisotropy. The present invention takes advantage of modern technology to make oil exploration and exploitation more efficient and productive. The production of hydrocarbons from subsurface formations commences by drilling a borehole through the earth to a target depth, to penetrate a subsurface reservoir considered to be hydrocarbon bearing. Finding and producing hydrocarbons efficiently and effectively requires understanding the rocks and fluids of a reservoir and of surrounding formations. Three basic oilfield measurements-electromagnetic, nuclear and acoustic\u0097have been devised to achieve this end. With advances in tool design and in data acquisition, processing and interpretation, each measurement type has evolved to produce more and different information. None, perhaps, has evolved more than the acoustic, or sonic, measurement. First sonic tool was introduced in 1951, by Humble Oil Company. In their early days, sonic measurements were relatively simple. They began as a way to match seismic signals to rock layers. Today, sonic measurements reveal a multitude of reservoir and well bore properties. They can be used infer primary and secondary porosity, permeability, lithology, mineralogy, pore pressure, invasion, anisotropy, fluid type, stress magnitude and direction, the presence and alignment of fractures and the quality of casing-cement bonds. The acoustic waves recorded by a sonic logging tool depend on the energy source, the path they take and the properties of the formation and the borehole. In wireline logging, there are two primary types of sources, monopole and dipole. From the borehole, various physical, chemical and mechanical properties are \u0093logged\u0094. Logged data is analyzed to determine various rock properties, like, porosity, permeability, mechanical properties, depth of the reservoir. One such logging technique commonly used in the industry is acoustic logging. Acoustic tool was first introduced in 1951 by Humble Oil Company. At first, sonic logging tools were used to provide a continuous velocity measurement in a borehole. These measurements were used to achieve better time-depth tie. With the advent of time, sonic logging has become much more complex. Presently, multiple sectored receivers generate a arrays of sonic data. These arrays are then analyzed to produce: a) Slowness values for compressional, shear and stoneley waves b) Porosity of logged sections c) Permeability of logged section d) Dynamic rock mechanical properties, like bulk, shear and young's moduli e) Direction of maximum stress from cross-dipole tools BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION The present invention provides an improved method for estimating anisotropic formation from wave data using present-day logging tools. Up until the present method, shear splitting has been used to identify fracture direction. Shear wave anisotropy, however, can only be used to depict the present-day stress regime of the fracture. Unfortunately, the present-day stress regime of the fracture may not coincide with the paleostress regime which actually caused the fracture. Although the polarization of compressional waves along anisotropic planes is documented for seismic waves, it has been assumed that compressional waves are non-dispersive, that they do not \u0093split\u0094 like shear waves, in the well-logging field.1 In contrast, however, the present invention demonstrates that compressional waves split very much like shear waves along fracture planes and provides the method for analyzing compressional wave anisotropy. Up until the present method, the well-logging industry has analyzed data by calculating the fracture from direct azimuth of shear waves. Using this methodology, however, may be misleading and does not take advantage of the modem tools and technology now available in this sector. The present method takes advantage of the sensitivity of modem technology to get a more accurate and complete result. Previous well-logging instruments could only provide data for perpendicular elongation of the fracture\u0097shear wave stress. Innovations in the field, however, can provide data for compressional waves that are more subtle, longitudinal elongations along the matrix. Although the instruments have become more updated, the methodology for analyzing the data has not. Compressional waves have been ignored in well-logging until now. As the present method demonstrates, the data from compressional waves should not be dismissed. Shear energy anisotropy only represents the present day stress regime; the present day stress regime may or may not reflect the stress regime that actually caused the fracture. Stress fields change with time as does the direction of the stress applied. Therefore, calculating fracture from a direct azimuth of the shear stress provides an inaccurate stress history of the basin, causing errors in well placement and leading to more costly operations. In contrast, the present method provides a more complete and accurate picture of the stress history of the basin by using compressional anisotropy azimuth. Since the present method leads to more surety in fracture cause, well placement will be more accurate in the field. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1.

Side-by-side Comparison of Shear and Compressional Anisotropy Azimuth showing that Shear and Compressional waves do not always give the same result. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION To further understanding of the present invention, the following discussion is provided. Shear wave energy propagates in a direction perpendicular to the stress motion. When shear waves encounter anisotropic formations, they undergo shear wave \u0093splitting\u0094 (the shear wave partitions into two components). Anisotropic formations can be caused by cracks and fractures, for example. The basins caused by these fractures may be indicative of an oil reservoir. As a result, shear wave splitting is used to determine fracture direction to identify the characteristics of the basin. Moreover, in well-logging, it has been assumed that compressional waves are non-dispersive\u0097that they do not split like shear waves. Compressional wave energy propagates longitudinally along the matrix. Older technologies could not provide accurate data on compressional wave propagation because it results in a subtler disruption. Present day tools, however, can provide accurate data of compressional wave anisotropy. Compressional wave anisotropy provides an alternative and perhaps a replacement of shear wave anisotropy. Although the current standard, use of shear wave anisotropy depicts only the present day stress regime of the fracture. Since the present-day stress regime may not accurately represent the stress that actually caused the fracture, the conclusions drawn from the shear wave anisotropy analysis may be inaccurate and do not fully utilize the capabilities of modern well-logging tools. Furthermore, the present method demonstrates that compressional waves split along fracture planes much like shear waves and actually provide a more accurate depiction of the basins since compressional wave anisotropy analysis depicts the stress regime that caused the fracture in addition to the present-day stress regime. FIG. 5 shows azimuthal anisotropy from both a compressional and shear wave train. FIG. 5 demonstrates that anisotropy azimuth seen by compressional waves may be significantly different from that seen by shear waves. Anisotropy seen by compressional waves is a very subtle phenomenon. Raw data for compressional waveforms includes waves with a wide range of frequencies. Moreover, the frequency spectra of the waves at the same depth are not identical. Prior to analysis, therefore, the waveforms need to be filtered in the frequency domain in exactly the same window. Additionally, raw recorded waveforms also contain spurious and redundant events in the time domain. Prior to analysis, therefore, muting must also be used to retain relevant data and to eliminate unnecessary events. FIG. 1 shows a compressional waveform recorded by a logging tool. To begin the analysis, it must be noted that all waveforms, including compressional waveforms, recorded by a logging tool are affected by certain variances that need to be accounted for before any estimation of anisotropic azimuth can be calculated. Variances in recorded waveforms may be caused by tool eccentricity while logging or receiver output variations, for example. In order to account for these variances and correct for them when analyzing the data, Step 1 requires calculating the RMS energy of each compressional waveform. FIG. 2 depicts the RMS evergy output of 4 receivers at the same depth. Furthermore, FIG. 2 shows the wide variation in energy output of the four, sectored receivers at the same depth. Step 2 requires normalizing the waveforms so that all four sectored have the same output energy at the same depth. In order to normalize the data, one of the four receivers must be used as a standard. FIG. 3 shows the RMS energy output of the same receivers as shown in FIG. 2 after normalization. Furthermore, FIG. 3 shows that the output variations in the receivers have been corrected. Step 3 requires depth averaging to achieve stacking of waveforms. Since, in well logging, there are no stacking mechanisms for acoustic waveforms at the same depth point currently available, depth averaging is used to achieve stacking of waveforms. No significant error results from this because anisotropy is a slow phenomenon; azimuth of anisotropy changes very slowly. Step 4 requires the rotation of the final pre-processed waveform, as shown in FIG. 4, using the Alford rotation method. The Alford rotation method is accomplished using the following equations (1)-(7), where the waveform is rotated in steps of 1 degree from 0 to 90 degrees and where the RMS energy of the rotated waveforms is noted for every degree. s1=sin2(theta)\u2003\u2003(1) s2=cos2(theta)\u2003\u2003(2) s3=sin(theta)*cos(theta)\u2003\u2003(3) x[0]=xx*s2+yy*s1+(xy+yx)*s3;\u2003\u2003(4) x[1]=xy*s2\u2212yx*s1+(yy\u2212xx)*s3;\u2003\u2003(5) x[2]=yx*s2\u2212xy*s1+(yy\u2212xx)*s3;\u2003\u2003(6) x[3]=yy*s2+xx*s1\u2212(xy+yx)*s3;\u2003\u2003(7) Once the waveforms have been rotated, the waveforms may then be used to determine the fracture characteristics.",
